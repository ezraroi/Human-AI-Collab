# Salience Network Core (AIC + dACC)   
A large-scale network associated with detecting salience (internal/external), allocating attention, and coordinating switching between internally oriented self-processing and externally oriented task/executive processing. In your mapping, it is the candidate gating mechanism that enables **“doing both”**: sustained contact with affective/self material while also engaging executive integration.   
**System role in Third Intelligence**   
- **Switching / gating substrate** linking:   
    - [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (interoception)   
    - [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (metabolization)   
    - [Triple Network](triple-network-model.md) dynamics (DMN ↔ FPN coordination)   
   
**Operational markers (candidate proxies)**   
- Network switching indices (EEG/fMRI paradigms).   
- Within-session “salience moments” aligning with felt sense intensification and/or felt shift events (hypothesis).   
   
**Testable predictions (how it constrains the model)**   
- **Metabolization:** salience engagement rises during contact with difficult material and supports coordinated switching into integrative processing (not stuck rumination, not detached analysis).   
- **Bypass ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)):** high executive/language output with reduced salience/interoceptive engagement.   
- **Collapse:** salience overwhelms regulation capacity (ties back to ANS/[HPA](hpa-axis.md)), leading to dysregulated switching and loss of self-holding.   
   
**Relations (wiring)**   
- **Core mechanism in:** Triple Network Model (but singled out for measurement focus)   
- **Bridges:** [AIC](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md) ↔ Triple Network object (you can either keep this as separate or fold into AIC + TNM wiring)   
- **Enables:** “[Doing Bot](the-doing-both-hypothesis.md)h” hypothesis; embodied-to-symbolic integration   
- **Constrained by:** ANS regulation / [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) capacity   
   
**Notes**   
This object exists to prevent overloading “[Triple Network Model](triple-network-model.md)” with everything. It makes the gating mechanism explicit and therefore measurable.
