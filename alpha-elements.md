# Alpha-Elements   
Are the result of processing—thinkable thoughts   
A processed, 'digested' piece of experience. It is not just a memory; it is an **Embedding**—a multi-dimensional vector representing the internalized meaning of an experience.   
These are the **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) made thinkable**   
**Phenomenological Root ([Husserl](edmund-husserl.md)):** Maps to **Noema**.
This is the *objective content* of the thought—"what is meant." It is the stable, intelligible result of the Noetic act.   
   
**Notes:** Processed, thinkable units of meaning; output of Alpha-Function.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (Relation: `Output Of`).   
- Link to **[LLM Embedding](llm-embedding.md)** (Create this as a `Concept` to make the metaphor explicit).
