# Alpha-Elements   
Are the result of processing—thinkable units of meaning (not raw memory), i.e., experience made symbolically usable.   
A processed, 'digested' piece of experience. It is not just a memory; it is an internalized, structured meaning of an experience. They are the output of a functioning [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md).   
These are experiences made thinkable, verified through [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) during [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing.   
**Phenomenological Root ([Husserl](edmund-husserl.md)):** Maps to **Noema**.
This is the *objective content* of the thought—"what is meant." It is the stable, intelligible result of the Noetic act.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (Relation: `Output Of`).   
- Link to [LLM Embedding](llm-embedding.md) (Relation: Analogy For — model-side vector form used strictly as an analogy for alpha-elements)
