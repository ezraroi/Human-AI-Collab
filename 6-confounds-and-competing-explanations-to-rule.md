# 6. Confounds and Competing Explanations to Rule Out   
The agenda must explicitly test against at least:   
- Expectancy/placebo/authority halo   
- Novelty effects   
- Generic cognitive offloading (extended mind without transformation)   
- Narrative coherence without metabolization (semantic reframe mistaken for change)   
- Detached reappraisal / dissociation (relief without integration)   
- Life event confounds (external changes driving outcomes)   
- Sleep improvement alone (consolidation effects independent of the reflective mechanism)
