# Rubber Duck Debugging   
Rubber duck debugging is a problem-solving and debugging technique in software engineering.   
1. Method: A programmer explains their code, step by step, in natural language, either aloud or in writing, to reveal mistakes and misunderstandings.   
2. Origin and Variations: The practice gets its name from a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer, where a developer carried a rubber duck and explained code line by line to it. Variations of this practice use other inanimate objects, such as a stuffed animal like a teddy bear, a mug, or even a co-worker who is recruited into the passive role of the "duck".   
3. Classification: Within a taxonomy of the software debugging process, RDD is classified as a reasoning strategy under the dimension "How is debugging performed?". It is specifically defined as articulating the problem to expose inconsistencies.   
   
**Notes:** Externalizing thought to detect cognitive errors; used in [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md).
