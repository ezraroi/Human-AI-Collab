# 1. The Core Hypothesis: Practice-Dependent Neuroplasticity   
Our model is predicated on the fact that the adult brain is not fixed. Neuroplasticity is a lifelong process where the brain changes its structure and function in response to "intense, prolonged, or repeated" experience.   
The "Black Box" Refinement:   
We are not making a vague claim that "practice = plasticity." We hypothesize that your [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) (RP) practice is a bundle of specific, known plasticity-inducing techniques.   
- Metacognitive Monitoring (a core part of RP) is a form of focused attention and cognitive control known to strengthen the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) [cite: 748, 796-797].   
- Embodied Verification ("spacious vs. tight") is a form of interoceptive attention practice, which is hypothesized to induce changes in the Insula ([AIC](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md)) [cite: 567, 888].   
- Emotional Processing (managing the "fear and uncertainty" of identity change) is a form of cognitive reappraisal, known to strengthen PFC-Amygdala connectivity [cite: 572, 1961-1962].   
   
The 43 notebooks are the log file of this sustained, multi-faceted training program. The 43:1 ratio is the observable outcome of the resulting neuroplastic changes.
