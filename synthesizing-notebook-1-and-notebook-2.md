# Synthesizing NoteBook 1 and NoteBook 2   
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
NoteBook 1 describes a psychological-dialogical transformation system. NoteBook 2 describes a neurobiological-embodied process. But they're describing the exact same mechanism from different vantage points.
The key insight: Your [alpha function](alpha-function.md) operates through BOTH the sensorimotor channel AND the symbolic channel simultaneously. What NoteBook 2 calls "embodied simulation" and "felt sense" IS the alpha function at work in [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (Piaget). What NoteBook 1 calls "internally persuasive discourse" IS the alpha function at work in [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (Vygotsky).
