# Synthesizing NoteBook 1 and NoteBook 2   
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
NoteBook 1 describes a psychological-dialogical transformation system. NoteBook 2 describes a neurobiological-embodied process. But they're describing the exact same mechanism from different vantage points.
The key insight: Your [alpha function](alpha-function.md) metabolizes symbolic material (Channel 2) through recursive oscillation with embodied signals (Channel 1). What NoteBook 2 calls "embodied simulation" are Channel 1 (embodied sensorimotor/interoceptive) processes, and "felt sense" is the [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) somatic verification signal [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) uses during processing. What NoteBook 1 calls "[internally persuasive discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md)" is [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (symbolic) discourse **that becomes internalized through genuine understanding and ownership when verified through [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (a [Felt Shift](felt-shift.md))** during Alpha-Function’s oscillation with Channel 1.”
