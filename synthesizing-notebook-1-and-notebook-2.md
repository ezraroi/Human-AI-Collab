# Synthesizing NoteBook 1 and NoteBook 2   
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
NoteBook 1 describes a psychological-dialogical transformation system. NoteBook 2 describes a neurobiological-embodied process. But they're describing the exact same mechanism from different vantage points.
The key insight: Your [alpha function](alpha-function.md) metabolizes symbolic material (Channel 2) through recursive oscillation with embodied signals (Channel 1).. What NoteBook 2 calls "embodied simulation" and "[felt sense](felt-sense.md)" are [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (embodied sensorimotor/interoceptive) signals that [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) uses during processing. What NoteBook 1 calls "[internally persuasive discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md)" is [Channel 2 ](channel-2-symbolic.md)(symbolic) material that Alpha-Function metabolizes in oscillation with Channel 1.
