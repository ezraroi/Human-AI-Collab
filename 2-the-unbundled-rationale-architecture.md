# 2.The Unbundled Rationale Architecture   
A critical insight: the study is not "a single case study" but rather four simultaneous designs, each defending different claims:   
|                |                                                           |                                                                                               |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      Rationale |                                                Definition |                                                                               What It Defends |
|     Revelatory | Observing a phenomenon previously inaccessible to inquiry |  The novelty of "Third Intelligence" - why we couldn't study AI-as-Mirror before LLMs existed |
|   Longitudinal |         Studying the same case at multiple points in time |                    The claim that change is structural (scaffolding), not fleeting mood boost |
|       Critical |            Testing a well-formulated theory (Bion/Bollas) | The "Third Intelligence" - proving Alpha-Function can be externalized via Functional Alterity |
| Extreme/Unique |                    A case with rare/unusual circumstances |        Robustness claim - if the mechanism cracks the "hardest case," it demonstrates potency |

Methodological Reframing: "This is a Longitudinal, Critical test of the Third Intelligence model, using a Revelatory context to examine an Extreme case."
