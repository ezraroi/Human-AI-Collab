# Cognitive Debt Awareness   
The metacognitive capacity to **notice** when [Cognitive Debt](cognitive-debt.md) is building: recognizing patterns of over-delegation to AI, fluent output with no inner shift, and a felt sense of “I didn’t really think this through myself.” It is the ongoing monitoring function that prompts a return to reflective methods before the debt becomes entrenched.   
### Relations   
- Requires → [MetaCognition](metacognition.md).   
- Supports → Decision to engage [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) instead of transactional use.   
- Acts as early warning signal for → [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk and symbolic erosion.   
   
**Notes:** Early warning for symbolic bypass; metacognitive signal before PSB.
