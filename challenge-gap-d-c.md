# Challenge Gap (\|D–C\|)   
The structural tension field between the **[Difficulty](d-difficulty.md) of a subject (D)** and the human’s Current [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) to metabolize it.   
A **diagnostic metaphor** indicating the degree of symbolic work required before any scaffolding or dialogical support enters.   
**System Role**   
Represents the pre-existing pre-dialogical developmental tension that makes transformation necessary.   
Indicates the baseline scaffolding demand (Sₑ × Sₜ) for the material to become metabolizable.   
It is the **condition** of transformation, not the **arena** where transformation occurs.   
### Distinctions   
- **Not measurable**: Represents a structural relation, not a quantitative variable.   
- **Not modulated by AI**: The gap pre-exists; the system only works *within* it.   
- **Not equivalent to ZPD**: The [ZPD](zpd.md) is the **workable subset** of this gap activated through scaffolding.   
   
### Relations   
- **Conditions → [ZPD](zpd.md)**   
    (The ZPD emerges only as a *subset* of the Challenge Gap when scaffolding is present.)   
- **Pre-condition for → [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) ignition**   
    (No tension → no symbolic metabolism.)   
- **Shaped/Experienced Through → [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)**   
    (Alterity does not create the gap but influences how the user encounters it inside the ZPD.)
