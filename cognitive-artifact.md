# Cognitive Artifact   
A **Cognitive Artifact** is fundamentally an **external tool**, whether physical or symbolic.   
Its function is to **extend human cognitive capabilities** and help **overcome cognitive limitations** by storing information, scaffolding processes, and structuring tasks.   
The AI is reframed as a cognitive artifact—a tool—rather than a partner. When a person uses a cognitive artifact, they constitute a single, **integrated cognitive functional system.**   
Treating [AI](ai.md) as this (a "[Piagetian](jean-piaget.md) Object") is key to avoiding the Category Error.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[AI](ai.md)** (Relation: `Definition Of`).   
- Link to **[Jean Piaget](jean-piaget.md)** (Relation: `Based On`).
