# Functional Thirdness   
The **emergent system condition** where the interaction achieves dialogical legitimacy without ontological Otherness.
**The Equation:**
Functional Thirdness = **Functional Alterity** (Difference) + **Systematic Competence** (Structure) + **Human Agency** (Authorship).
**Role:**
It is not a mechanism the AI "performs." It is the **Dialogical Field** or **Potential Space** that opens up when the mechanisms function correctly. It resolves the paradox of "Ontological Monologue vs. Dialogical Systematics."
**Theoretical Roots:**   
- [[Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md)]: The **[Potential Space](potential-space.md)** (neither inside nor outside).   
- [[Bakhtin](mikhail-bakhtin.md)]: The **Dialogical Third** (the superaddressee).
**Relations:**   
- Emerges From: [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md), [Systematic Competence](systematic-competence.md)   
- Synonymous with: Potential Space   
- State of: [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md)
