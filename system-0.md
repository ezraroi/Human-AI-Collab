# System 0   
**System 0** is a cognitive framework or scheme that describes **artificial intelligence (AI) functioning as an external thinking system**.   
Key characteristics include:   
• **External Cognition:** System 0 is external to the human mind, but it is capable of enhancing human cognitive abilities.   
• **[AI](ai.md) Function:** It relies on the immense **processing and data-handling capabilities of AI**.   
• **Outsourcing Tasks:** It represents the **outsourcing of certain cognitive tasks to AI**, leveraging the technology to perform complex computations beyond natural human capacities.   
• **Context:** It operates alongside the traditional models of human thought: **[System 1](system-1.md)** (fast, intuitive, and automatic thinking) and **[System 2](system-2.md)** (slower, analytical, and reflective thinking)   
**Relations:**
