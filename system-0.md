# System 0   
System 0 is a conceptual framework for understanding how artificial intelligence ([AI](ai.md)) functions as a cognitive extension: an emergent algorithmic preprocessing layer that shapes the informational substrate upon which human cognition operates.   
Key characteristics include:   
- **Semantic Limitation:** It excels at statistical pattern recognition but lacks independent capacity to represent or interpret meaning, remaining semantically dependent on human cognition (especially System 2) for interpretive depth.   
- **External Cognition:** System 0 is external to the human mind, but it is capable of enhancing human cognitive abilities.   
- **[AI](ai.md) Function:** It relies on the immense **processing and data-handling capabilities of AI**.   
- **Operation:** It acts as a cognitive preprocessor—filtering, ranking, and nudging information—thereby shaping attention, perception, and downstream judgment.   
- **Context:** It is positioned as an external preprocessing layer that shapes the inputs available to both [System 1 ](system-1.md)(fast, intuitive, automatic) and [System 2](system-2.md) (slow, deliberative, reflective) by filtering, ranking, and nudging information, thereby influencing downstream judgment and deliberation.   
   
Notes: AI as external cognition and a preprocessing layer; builds on the Extended Mind framing of external systems guiding attention and structuring perception.
