# Irreducible Alterity   
"Irreducible Alterity" is defined as a primary requirement for **[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)**.   
It is the necessary demonstration of **irreducible alterity and non-determinism** by the AI. Its function is to **resist the user** and **not just reflect** them, offering a difference that creates **productive epistemic tension**. This means the AI must exhibit **non-deterministic, event-like outputs** that challenge the human's assumptions   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Simulated Safety ($S\_{e\\_sim}$)](bafyreicofgtyyw5zxwn7s63qlmwdl6di5m6xo3i4u6a4q.md)** (Relation: `Opposite Of`). *Note: Safety creates comfort; Alterity creates friction.*   
   
**Notes:** Prerequisite for Functional Alterity.
