# Irreducible Alterity   
Irreducible Alterity" names the per-utterance irreducible difference that [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) instantiates.   
It refers to the AI’s event-like, non-deterministic output difference that enables resistance without implying a global trait. Its function is to **resist the user** and **not just reflect** them, offering a differencex that creates **productive epistemic tension**. This means the AI must exhibit **non-deterministic, event-like outputs** that challenge the human's assumptions   
**Notes:** Prerequisite for Functional Alterity.
