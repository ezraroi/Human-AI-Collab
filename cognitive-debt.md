# Cognitive Debt   
The accumulated **metabolic deficit** that results from repeatedly adopting symbolic material ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)) without digesting and without embodied verification ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)). Over time, Cognitive Debt manifests as fluent-but-hollow understanding, decision-making based on borrowed frameworks, and progressive disconnection from somatic and autobiographical integrity.   
### System Role   
- Provides a **general umbrella** for long-term costs of [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) style usage.   
- Explains why occasional misuse can compound into structural erosion of self-trust and alpha-function.

### Relations   
- Manifests as → [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md);    
- Accumulates when → [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) is bypassed; Reflective methods are skipped.   
- Prevented / reduced by → [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md); [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md); [Felt Sense.](felt-sense.md)
