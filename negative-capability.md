# Negative Capability   
**Definition:** The operational metric of genuine growth. The ability to sustain uncertainty, hold partial answers, and tolerate the "tightness" of the unready-to-hand state without rushing to resolution.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** (Relation: `Antidote To` - PSB is "Low Negative Capability" ).   
- Link to **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** (Relation: `Relies On` - tolerating the "tightness" ).
