# Negative Capability   
Negative capability is not a fixed personality trait but a developmental achievement that varies with context and current [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ). When Sₑ is depleted, negative capability contracts; when Sₑ is adequate, the capacity to remain in not-knowing expands.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** (Relation: `Antidote To` - PSB is "Low Negative Capability" ).   
- Link to **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** (Relation: Relies On - tolerating difficult [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)signals such as "tightness").   
   
**Notes:** Central developmental operator in your system.
