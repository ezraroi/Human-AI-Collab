# Negative Capability   
The operational capacity underlying genuine growth. The ability to sustain uncertainty, hold partial answers, and tolerate the "tightness" of the unready-to-hand state without rushing to resolution.   
**Relations:**

- Link to **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** (Relation: Relies On - tolerating difficult [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)signals such as "tightness").   
   
**Notes:** Central developmental operator in your system.
