# 3. The Discriminator Framework   
The validation agenda requires classifying sessions into competing mechanistic states, then testing whether biology tracks those states reliably.   
### 3.1 Alpha-Function is the discriminated phenomenon (not a pipeline step)   
[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) is a **human metabolic process**, not an AI capability and not an “information processing stage.” It refers to the transformation of raw, affect-laden material into **thinkable, ownable form**, which occurs only when **embodied contact and symbolic processing remain coupled** long enough for integration to happen.   
In this agenda, “metabolization” is defined as **successful Alpha-Function**, while **fluent bypass** and **boundary collapse** are defined as failure modes where Alpha-Function does not occur (despite possible high semantic output or subjective relief). AI can provide technical scaffolding and structured difference, but **cannot perform Alpha-Function or provide containment**; the Human remains the container and the metabolic agent.   
### 3.2 Transformation-viable metabolization   
Definition:
A session in which difficult material is contacted (felt sense present), integrated (felt shift / symbolic update), and produces downstream ownership and persistence.   
Candidate markers (triangulated, none sufficient alone)   
- Experiential: [felt sense](felt-sense.md) contact + “felt shift” event   
- Physiology: arousal that remains within tolerable range + recovery toward baseline ([ANS](autonomic-nervous-system-regulation-ans-vagal-.md)); no sustained stress overload ([HPA](hpa-axis.md))   
- Behavioral ownership: can reconstruct insight without AI; journaling persists; real-world verification occurs   
- Neural dynamics (hypothesized): coordinated switching/integration dynamics ([triple-network](triple-network-model.md) / salience gating)   
   
### 3.3 Fluent bypass ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) / “pretty coherence”)   
Definition (operational):
High semantic output and felt “clarity” without embodied integration or durable ownership.   
Candidate markers   
- Experiential: weak felt sense contact; no genuine felt shift (or “[felt shift](felt-shift.md)” only as narrative satisfaction)   
- Physiology: minimal embodied arousal change or incoherent patterns; no clear integration/recovery signature   
- Behavioral: outputs are hard to reconstruct without AI; limited persistence; “felt productive” without metabolized change   
- Neural dynamics (hypothesized): executive/language dominance without corresponding salience/interoceptive engagement   
   
### 3.4 Boundary collapse (Category Error / dysregulation)   
Definition (operational):
Loss of self-holding capacity under load (or drift into non-viable field conditions), leading to dependence, escalation, or instability.   
Candidate markers   
- Experiential: loss of grounded self-reference; compulsive continuation; reduced skepticism; reality-testing erosion   
- Physiology: sustained dysregulation (ANS) and/or stress overload (HPA), poor recovery   
- Behavioral: escalating use; inability to stop; weakened offline functioning; post-session instability   
   
### 3.5 Reward-driven pseudo-safety (dependency risk pathway)   
Definition (operational):
The interaction feels safe/relieving primarily due to reinforcement/validation loops rather than metabolization.   
Candidate markers   
- Experiential: strong relief without felt shift; “I feel held” without ownership criteria   
- Behavioral: repetition driven by relief/validation; “one more turn” compulsion; substitution for offline verification   
   
Physiology/neural (hypothesized): reward/reinforcement signatures may increase while integration markers do not
