# Channel 2 (Symbolic)   
Channel 2 is the **symbolic, linguistic, and dialogical pathway** through which meaning arrives from outside the body—via language, concepts, theory, discourse, and AI output.   
### System Role   
- Provides **symbolic material** that the system must metabolize.   
- Is the channel within which [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) operates turn-by-turn (in AI utterances) as difference and challenge.   
- Can trigger the experience of productive tension essential for transformation when encountered within a scaffolded [ZPD](zpd.md) (without creating the [Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md))   
- Works in **recursive oscillation** with [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) during [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) cycles.   
- Is the **sole channel of AI input** into the human mind.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Theorists:** [Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md) (Symbolic Mediation); [Bakhtin](mikhail-bakhtin.md) (Dialogism); Bruner (Narrative Thought).   
- **Biological Substrate:** Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN); Language Networks; Working Memory Systems.   
- **Connected Objects:** [AI](ai.md) (DTO); [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md); [ZPD](zpd.md); [Journal](journal.md) (as symbolic artifact); [Category Error](category-error.md); [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md).   
   
**Notes:** Symbolic input source; language-based meaning; AI’s entry point.
