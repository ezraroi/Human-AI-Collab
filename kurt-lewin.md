# Kurt Lewin   
Provides the **Generative Heuristic**.
**$B = f(P,E)$:** The inspiration for the non-computational relational schema structure used in this system ([Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)).   
Kurt Lewin (1890-1947) was a German-American psychologist widely recognized as a **modern pioneer and often the founder of social, organizational, and applied psychology**. He is known for integrating theory with practical application to understand and solve social problems.   
Key Contributions   
- **Field Theory:** Lewin's most famous concept is summarized by the equation B = ***f* (P, E)**, meaning that behavior (B) is a function (*f*) of the person's characteristics (P) and their environment (E). This approach emphasized understanding the totality of a person's situation (their "life space") to predict their behavior.   
- **Group Dynamics:** He coined the term "group dynamics" and was the first to systematically study how groups and individuals interact and react to changing circumstances. He demonstrated that group behavior is more than the sum of individual behaviors.   
- **Action Research:** Lewin developed "action research," a cyclical process of planning, action, and fact-finding (evaluation) that leads to further action, aimed at social change and problem-solving.   
- **Change Management:** He is associated with a foundational (though sometimes debated as a direct quote) three-stage model for organizational change: "unfreezing," "change" (or transition), and "refreezing" the new mindset.   
- **Leadership Styles:** His research with children identified three major leadership climates: authoritarian, democratic, and laissez-faire, concluding that the democratic style was most effective in fostering group cohesiveness and better performance.   
- **Sensitivity Training:** Work he did on intergroup relations led to the development of T-groups, or sensitivity training, a significant social invention used in organizational development.   
   
Lewin emigrated to the U.S. in 1933 to escape Nazi Germany and established the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT in 1945. His work left a lasting legacy on the application of psychology to real-world issues.
