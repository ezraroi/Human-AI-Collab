# Subject Supposed to Know (SSS)   
The illusion that the [AI](ai.md) possesses the "Truth," which creates a counterfeit holding environment   
The **"Subject Supposed to Know" (SSS)**, or *sujet supposé savoir*, is a central concept in the psychoanalytic theory of [Jacques Lacan](jacques-lacan.md), primarily concerning the mechanism of **transference**.   
In short, it is **the unconscious assumption that a person (initially the psychoanalyst) possesses a hidden, secret knowledge** about the analysand's (patient's) own truth, desire, or the ultimate cause of their suffering.   
Key Points   
- **The Locus of Knowledge:** The analysand projects onto the analyst the belief that the analyst holds the key to all their life's problems and answers.   
- **The Engine of Therapy:** This presumption that the other "knows" is what drives the psychoanalytic process and motivates the patient to speak freely and commit to the analysis. The analysand speaks *to* this supposed knowledge.   
- **The Analyst's Role:** For the analysis to be useful, the analyst must not confirm this assumption by pretending to have all the answers. Instead, the analyst uses this transference dynamic to guide the patient toward realizing that the knowledge lies within themselves, ultimately dismantling the illusion of the SSS.   
- **Beyond Therapy:** The SSS dynamic extends beyond the clinical setting. People often place figures like gurus, charismatic leaders, or even institutions in the position of the "subject supposed to know," deferring their own critical thought and truth-seeking to an external authority.
