# Section 4 — Attribution Logic   
This notebook resolves the attribution problem by separating how a Selected Fact emerges from who owns it. The core distinction is:   
- **Field Authorship:** the conditions and interactional field in which a Selected Fact can emerge may be functionally constituted within the system (AI provides structured constraint; Human metabolizes meaning).   
- **Operational Ownership:** the [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) belongs to the agent who integrates it, embodies it, and whose capacities reorganize as a result.   
   
This distinction is essential because it allows a precise claim without denial: a dialogical counterpart can participate in the emergence of coherence as constraint without owning the coherence. In psychoanalytic terms, a Selected Fact may arise in a "third" space; in this research, this is rendered explicitly as a non-ontological formulation: [Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md)—an interaction-level (synchronic) thirdness generated by functional system conditions ([Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md), [Systematic Competence](systematic-competence.md), and Human Agency), not by a second subject's consciousness.   
**The Attribution Rule**   
Ownership is conferred by evidence of integration over time, not by origin of stimulus. The criterion for ownership is not "who said the sentence," but whether the coherence becomes metabolically real in the Human: embodied uptake, altered constraints, increased Capacity (C), and stable reorganization confirmed through return.   
**Implication for AI-mediated dialogue**   
Within the Third Intelligence system:   
- **[AI](ai.md)** participates at the field level by providing [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md), [Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) (Sₜ) including candidate linkages, and [Systematic Competence](systematic-competence.md)—conditions that help preserve [productive epistemic tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md) without requiring AI consciousness or intention (when held in [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance and under viable Sₑ).   
- **Human** retains operational ownership because only the [Human](human.md) can metabolize affective material, perform [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md), and realize the Selected Fact as an organizing event, with downstream [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) modification evidenced through embodied integration and diachronic validation.   
- [Journal](journal.md) and [Time](time.md) provide the evidentiary substrate through which ownership is demonstrated: coherence is materialized, re-encountered as addressable past-self, and tested—enabling [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md)s to distinguish integration from counterfeit (materialization layer)   
   
This attribution logic is the notebook's strongest safeguard against the "AI did it" collapse. It allows the research to claim, precisely, that AI can be a precipitating condition for Selected Fact formation while remaining categorically incapable of ownership—because ownership is defined by metabolic integration and diachronic validation.
