# Section 3 — Causal Sequence Placement   
This notebook locates [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) within a causal sequence that distinguishes raw experience, metabolic processing, and coherent knowing. The essential ordering, as adopted for this research, is:   
[beta-elements](beta-elements.md) (raw, unprocessed material)
→ conditions for digestion (containment and tolerable not-knowing)
→ [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) activity (metabolization into thinkable form)
→ [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md) (processed material)
→ Selected Fact (organizing coherence event)
→ coherent knowing / interpretation (K)   
Two placements are critical:   
1. **SF is downstream of metabolizability, not upstream of it.** SF does not "create" processing. It becomes possible when material has become sufficiently thinkable and bearable for organization to occur. The Selected Fact is therefore not the first move in transformation; it is a coherence event that can emerge only once fragmentation has become processable through alpha-function.   
2. **SF is the bridge between processed material and stable knowing.** alpha-elements can exist as discrete, processed units without yet forming a unified pattern. SF is the moment the system selects a configuration that binds them into a coherent whole—after which interpretation and meaning-making become anchored rather than speculative.   
   
**Mapping to the four-component system**   
This placement clarifies the role of each system component:   
- **[Human](human.md):** the site of alpha-function performance and the only location where metabolization occurs; SF is realized here as an organizing event through embodied uptake and integration—not in an external dialogical artifact.   
- **[AI](ai.md):** participates prior to SF by supplying [Technical Scaffolding (Sₜ)](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md), candidate linkages, and [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) that helps preserve productive tension within a workable [ZPD](zpd.md) (when scaffolding conditions are adequate); it can contribute to the conditions of organization, but not to ownership of the organizing event.   
- **[Journal](journal.md):** stabilizes processed material as an external trace, enabling return to scattered α-elements and preventing loss of probationary, not-yet-stabilized meaning; provides a substrate in which candidate configurations can be revisited, compared, and tested across time.   
- **[Time](time.md):** makes the sequence operational rather than merely conceptual. While the SF "click" may occur within a session, its status as a genuine Selected Fact is confirmed only through probationary validation at T+n (return, persistence, deepening, and downstream capacity change). Time is therefore part of causal efficacy, not a backdrop.   
   
This causal placement is foundational for later claims: it protects against the notion that "the AI generated the insight," and it explains why coherence experiences must be evaluated by downstream integration and persistence—not by immediate intelligibility.
