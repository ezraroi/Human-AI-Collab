# MKO (More Knowledgeable Other)   
In this system, the AI supplies the **[technical scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) (Sₜ)** associated with MKO-guided assistance in the ZPD, without implying AI is a developmental ‘other’ beyond its functional role.   
The **More Knowledgeable Other (MKO)** is defined as **anyone** who has a **better understanding or a higher ability level** than the learner concerning a specific task, process, or concept.   
Key points about the MKO:   
• The MKO is generally a person, such as a teacher, instructor, knowledgeable adult, or a more capable peer.   
• The sources also specify that the MKO can be a younger person or **even a machine/computer**.   
• The assistance provided by the MKO is a vital element for the learner to reach their **potential level of development**, particularly within the Zone of Proximal Development ([ZPD](zpd.md))   
**Relations:**   
- **Operationalized As:** [Technical Scaffolding (S\_t)](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) - the dynamic measurement of current instructional support in the transformation formula   
- **Competence Dimension:** Technical Scaffolding represents the technical/instructional side of MKO function   
- **Split From:** [Emotional Scaffolding (S\_e)](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) - traditional MKO bundled both; your model separates them   
[Lev Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)    
   
**Notes:** AI as “more knowledgeable other” for Sₜ.
