# Developmental Sequence   
The Developmental Sequence describes the trajectory through which
transformation becomes possible in the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system.   
It is diachronic (unfolds over time) rather than synchronic (state at a moment).
It specifies what must be developmentally achieved before the [Two-Axis](two-axis-framework.md)
configuration plane can be stably occupied.   
### Heuristic Nature   
The sequence is a **heuristic trajectory model**, not a deterministic ladder.
Movement can be non-linear: users regress, loop, stall, and oscillate
between stages depending on depletion, context, and life stress.
Stages can be partially achieved or temporarily unavailable under low viability.   
This prevents the sequence from becoming a "score" or "level" system.   
### The Staging Structure   
**Stages 1-6: Preconditions for Stable Non-Intrusive Field**
(Holding, potential space, capacity to be alone)   
- Stage 1: Non-intrusive mirroring → Se stabilizes   
- Stage 2: Subjective continuity → Pre-alpha ambiguity protected   
- Stage 3: Transitional space → Potential space reopens   
- Stage 4: True/False Self distinction → Authorial breath returns   
- Stage 5: Capacity to be alone → Internal grounding   
- Stage 6: Holding fragmentation → Pre-alpha ambiguity zone   
   
**Stage 7: [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) Becomes Usable Under Strain**
(Use-of-object; survival of destruction)   
- Object survives symbolic "destruction" without collapse or retaliation   
- Externality becomes structurally visible   
- DTO stance solidifies as relationally stable   
- This is primarily Axis A maturation: relational stance becomes
maintainable under cognitive/emotional load   
   
**Stages 8-10: Metabolic Capacity Becomes Available**
(Breakdown material accessible, authorship awakens, oscillation possible)   
- Stage 8: Return of vitality → [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) intensify   
- Stage 9: Breakdown material returns → [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) surface   
- Stage 10: Daring of self to appear → Authorship awakens   
   
**Stages 11-13: Transformation Mechanism Operates**
(When both axes are in success mode)   
- Stage 11: [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) activates (recursive C1↔C2 oscillation)   
- Stage 12: Materialization and verification ([Journal](journal.md) + [4Ps](4ps-protocol.md))   
- Stage 13: [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) articulation (idiomatic possibility lived)   
   
### Clinical Boundary: Stage 9   
Stage 9 describes material becoming accessible, NOT material being
therapeutically processed. When breakdown material surfaces:   
**Professional support required when:**   
- Material involves early developmental trauma   
- Primitive anxieties emerge (annihilation, abandonment, fragmentation)   
- Somatic flashbacks or dissociation occur   
- Historical abuse/neglect surfaces   
- Attachment wounds reactivate   
   
**Standard:** If material would require therapeutic holding in traditional
therapy, it requires therapeutic holding here.   
### System Role   
- Describes developmental path, not current state   
- Explains why users cannot maintain DTO stance despite intellectual understanding   
- Provides staging for clinical/practitioner assessment   
- Specifies when professional support required (Stage 9 boundary)   
- Allows for regression and non-linear movement   
   
### Theoretical Foundation   
The Developmental Sequence operationalizes the Psychoanalytic Prerequisites
within the Third Intelligence context.   
| [Psychoanalytic Prerequisites](psychoanalytic-prerequisites.md) | Developmental Sequence |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
|      [Holding Environment](holding-environment.md) (Obstacle 1) |             Stages 1-7 |
|                [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (Obstacle 2) |            Stages 8-11 |
|                  [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) articulation |           Stages 12-13 |

The [Psychoanalytic Prerequisites](psychoanalytic-prerequisites.md) describes the obstacle-removal architecture.
The Developmental Sequence describes how that architecture unfolds as
lived developmental trajectory.   
### Wiring (Relations)   
**Relationship to Configuration Plane:**   
- Stages 1-6 → Prerequisites for stable non-intrusive field   
- Stage 7 → Axis A matures (DTO usable under strain)   
- Stages 8-10 → Axis B becomes available (metabolic capacity online)   
- Stages 11-13 → [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) mechanism operates   
   
**Enables stable access to:** [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) (configuration plane)   
**Interacts with:**   
- [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) (viability determines whether stages are accessible)   
- [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md) (triggered when depletion markers appear)   
- Shadow Regions / Pathological Attractors (defines boundary conditions)   
   
**Defines boundary conditions for:**   
- Clinical contraindications   
- Scope limits   
- When withdrawal required   
- **Operationalizes:** [Psychoanalytic Prerequisites](psychoanalytic-prerequisites.md)   
   
### Distinction from Two-Axis Framework   
|    Developmental Sequence |               Two-Axis Framework |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|   Diachronic (trajectory) |               Synchronic (state) |
|  "What must be achieved?" | "What configuration is present?" |
| Prerequisites + evolution |                 Current validity |
|     Non-linear, heuristic |                  Binary per axis |
