# Protégé Effect   
Raw content, need to define.   
A more powerful paradigm, proposed by recent research, is to view AI not as an oracle, but as a "Cognitive Mirror." This approach involves reconceptualizing the AI as a teachable novice that reflects the quality of your own explanation back at you. This method is grounded in the well-documented "Protégé Effect." The Protégé Effect works because teaching forces you to retrieve information, organize it coherently, and identify gaps in your own knowledge. Treating the AI as your student leverages this same powerful learning mechanism.
