# Minimal Self   
**Definition:** The most basic, instantaneous experience of being a subject. The "I can" that is simply given in any experience.
**System Role:** This is the entity that *uses* the system. It is the source of **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** verification.
**Distinction:** Unlike the **[Narrative Self](narrative-self.md)**, it is not constructed; it is immediate and present-moment.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Human](human.md)** (Relation: `Core Aspect Of`).   
- Link to [Narrative Self](narrative-self.md)  (Relation: `Distinct From`).   
   
**Notes:** Tacit sense of “I am”; source of embodied verification.
