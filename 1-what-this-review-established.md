# 1. What This Review Established   
### 1.1 [ZPD](zpd.md) as a Workable Subset of the \|D–C\| [Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md) (Structural Mapping)   
Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) describes optimal learning as occurring when challenge exceeds current capacity but remains achievable with appropriate guidance and support.   
Within the context of this work, the \|D–C\| term names the **pre-existing structural tension field** (Challenge Gap), and the ZPD is the **workable subset** of that gap that emerges **only when scaffolding makes the tension negotiable**. This preserves the ontological directionality: the Challenge Gap conditions the possibility of ZPD; ZPD is not prior to \|D–C\|.   
This mapping makes qualitative descriptions more analyzable in terms of observable failure patterns (without treating \|D–C\| as a precise measurable quantity):   
- \|D–C\| is qualitatively near-zero → stagnation (insufficient tension; no developmental pressure)   
- \|D–C\| is large relative to available Sₑ × Sₜ → overwhelm (ZPD cannot emerge)   
- \|D–C\| is within a metabolizable range given adequate Sₑ and Sₜ → workable tension (ZPD emerges)   
   
Claim strength: High. Clear alignment with established theory and with the model’s structural relations.   
### 1.2 The Split [MKO](mko-more-knowledgeable-other.md) as an Extension of Scaffolding Theory   
Traditional Vygotskian accounts often treat the More Knowledgeable Other (MKO) as a single bundled source of guidance and support. This model makes explicit a distinction often implicit but rarely formalized:   
- Technical support (guidance, structure, cognitive assistance) → operationalized here as Sₜ (AI as MKO function)   
- Relational support (safety, containment, affective stability) → operationalized here as Sₑ (human/relational holding function)   
   
By separating these contributions, the model explains why both forms of support are necessary and why their absence leads to predictable collapse modes.   
Claim strength: Moderate–high. Conceptually coherent; requires literature check in socio-emotional learning and affective computing.   
### 1.3 The Journal and Cognitive Apprenticeship   
Cognitive apprenticeship emphasizes “making thinking visible” through articulation, reflection, and guided practice. The [Journal](journal.md) aligns with this tradition while adding distinctive structural functions:   
- Externalization of reflective AI dialogue (metabolized dialogical work, not private monologue)   
- Stable substrate for revisiting and refining prior thinking   
- Material continuity across sessions   
- Support for cross-temporal pattern recognition   
   
Where cognitive apprenticeship emphasizes reflection as pedagogically central, this model treats materialization as structurally necessary for transformation (the Journal is not a diary, transcript, or memory aid, but continuity infrastructure).   
Claim strength: Moderate. Alignment is strong; further review of extended mind and distributed cognition is recommended.   
### 1.4 Reflective Prompting and Metacognitive Pedagogy   
Self-regulated learning research highlights planning, monitoring, and evaluation as core metacognitive functions. [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) supports these by:   
- Encouraging explicit evaluation rather than passive acceptance   
- Requiring articulation in one’s own words (self-explanation)   
- Maintaining an active stance of authorship and monitoring   
   
This positions Reflective Prompting as consistent with metacognitive best practices while serving a broader developmental aim.   
Claim strength: High. Clear conceptual alignment with metacognitive learning theory.
