# The Flywheel   
The **[Jim Collins](jim-collins.md) flywheel** is a business concept that describes how a series of small, consistent, and interconnected actions can build enormous, seemingly unstoppable momentum over time. It rejects the idea of a single "miracle moment" or grand program leading to success, emphasizing instead disciplined, cumulative effort.   
The Core Analogy   
Collins, in his book *Good to Great* and the companion monograph *Turning the Flywheel*, uses the analogy of a massive, heavy flywheel:   
- **Initial Effort:** Pushing the giant wheel at first takes tremendous effort to get it to move even an inch or a single rotation.   
- **Persistent Pushing:** Continuing to push in a consistent direction, turn after turn, builds speed and momentum.   
- **Breakthrough:** Eventually, the sheer weight and speed of the flywheel work for you, hurling it forward with its own momentum. At this point, the same amount of effort yields exponentially faster results.   
   
This process results in a **"reinforcing loop"** where each component logically drives the next, building sustained success.
