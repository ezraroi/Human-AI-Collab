# 2. Current State   
We have a coherent theoretical blueprint mapping system dynamics to plausible neural/physiological substrates.   
What we do not have is an empirical basis to answer:   
- “Does this system produce the predicted signatures?”   
- “Do those signatures track durable transformation rather than alternatives?”   
- “What distinguishes a good session from a counterfeit one biologically?”   
   
The gap is therefore not “missing scans.” It is missing:   
- discriminators,   
- contrasts, and   
- durability tracking.
