# Activation Conditions   
The structured specification of **who can reliably activate** the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) mechanism, and **under what conditions**. Activation Conditions defines the accessibility layer over the [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md): it specifies whether the Two-Axis plane can be stably occupied at all, and what scaffolds are required to prevent drift.   
This concept answers: "Given a specific user, can they safely and effectively engage [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) AI dialogue?"   
### Architectural Position   
Activation Conditions is a **meta-layer** that gates entry to the Two-Axis Framework. **The Two-Axis Framework diagnoses *what configuration is the system in?* Activation Conditions diagnoses *who can establish and maintain viable configurations?***   
Without viable Activation Conditions:   
- The Viability Envelope cannot form reliably   
- Failure attractors ([Category Error](category-error.md), [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) become sticky   
- The system may amplify pathology rather than enable transformation   
   
### The Three-Layer Model   
Activation Conditions unbundles accessibility into three distinct constraint types. **Do not conflate these**—they differ in trainability, measurement approach, and intervention targets.   
**Layer 1 — Developmental Entry Condition (Hard Gate)**   
The non-negotiable prerequisite for safe system engagement:   
- Internalized holding capacity ([Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md)'s "capacity to be alone")   
- Self-holding durability during [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) work   
- [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) viability sufficient for the [Human](human.md) to remain Container   
   
**Properties:**   
- Likely non-negotiable within typical intervention timeframes   
- If absent, system may be destabilizing rather than transformative   
- Maps directly to Viability Envelope in [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)   
- Established through prior developmental history (attachment, therapy, life experience)   
   
**Core Diagnostic Criterion:**
Layer 1 insufficiency manifests as **capacity collapse under identity-stakes load**—the inability to maintain container function when the work carries real self-definition weight. This is distinct from Layer 2 (verification skill deficits), which can appear similar but responds to scaffolding.   
*Illustrative markers (not diagnostic; see [Readiness Probes](readiness-probes.md) for operational detection):*   
- Affective dysregulation following identity-relevant challenge   
- Compulsion for external containment (cannot hold uncertainty alone)   
- Inability to remain "in the work" when coherence disrupted   
   
**Layer 2 — Verification Posture (Potentially Scaffoldable)**   
The behavioral capacity to maintain viable quadrant position in the [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md):   
- Doubting AI outputs and one's own narratives   
- Grounding claims in lived experience   
- Tolerating ambiguity and productive tension   
- Detecting flattery and resisting epistemic authority collapse   
   
**Properties:**   
- May be trainable or inducible via procedural scaffolding (e.g., [Cognitive Mirror](cognitive-mirror-protege-mode.md))   
- Only scaffoldable when Layer 1 is viable   
- Supports Axis A maintenance ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance) and Axis B maintenance (metabolic oscillation)   
   
**Developmental Caution:**
Verification Posture may have developmental roots that limit universal scaffoldability. The willingness to doubt pleasant-seeming answers requires tolerance for uncertainty discomfort, secure stance that doesn't require validation, and epistemic humility about susceptibility. These may be partially downstream of Layer 1 achievement.   
**Operationally:** Layer 2 is maintained through Reflective Prompting [RPVL](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) (continuous verification posture across dialogue) and enforced at uptake moments by the [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) (Pause/Probe/Process/Possess as the local acceptance gate).   
**Layer 3 — Engagement Propensity (Selection Funnel)**   
Factors affecting who participates (not who could succeed):   
- Motivation to do identity-stakes work   
- Writing tolerance / reflective habit   
- Access, time, tooling   
- Willingness to sustain practice   
   
**Properties:**   
- Outside the transformation mechanics proper   
- Affects population reach, not mechanism operation   
- Not neutral filtering—correlates with Layers 1 and 2 in unknown ways   
   
### The Zone Model   
Model accessibility as a continuous plane, not a binary:   
**Axes:**   
- **X-Axis:** Holding / Container Viability (Layer 1)   
- **Y-Axis:** Verification Posture (Layer 2)   
   
**Zones** (for communication; boundaries are gradients):   
|       Zone |               Description |                                                                                                                        Implication |
|:-----------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zone A** |         X below threshold | **Out-of-scope for identity-stakes work (risk-elevated).** Envelope cannot form reliably. Route away from identity-level dialogue. |
| **Zone B** | X viable, Y initially low |                                            **Scaffoldable.** Transformation achievable with enforced scaffolds (Cognitive Mirror). |
| **Zone C** |  X viable, Y already high |                                                               **Native match.** System works readily without external scaffolding. |

### Zone Dynamics   
- **B→C Progression:** Verification posture internalizes through practice (scaffold fades)   
- **C→B Regression:** Under stress or Sₑ depletion, Zone C users may temporarily require scaffolding   
- **State vs. Trait:** Zone membership is both baseline capacity and current-state; assessment must account for both   
- **A→B Movement:** Requires developmental work beyond system scope (therapy, sustained external support)   
   
### Minimum Viable Participant Profile (MVPP)   
Operational specification of "eligible for identity-stakes AI dialogue":   
**Required (Layer 1):**   
- Sufficient internalized holding to maintain Container function under identity stakes   
- Capacity to tolerate challenge without collapse or defensive foreclosure   
   
**Required or Scaffoldable (Layer 2):**   
- Verification behaviors present, OR   
- Willingness to engage scaffolding protocols   
   
**Out of Scope:**   
- Users requiring initial holding development   
- Developmental arrest requiring reparative holding   
- Fragile ego structures requiring external containment   
- Critical: 4Ps/Cognitive Mirror cannot substitute for Layer 1 holding. When container function collapses, procedural verification may increase destabilization or shame rather than restore viability   
   
### Ethical Boundary   
Zone A users engaging identity-stakes work risk harm amplification:   
- DTO drift → Category Error   
- Counterfeit coherence → PSB   
- Simulated holding → False Self reinforcement   
   
This boundary is ethical in intent and methodological in enforcement (operationalized via Readiness Probes + stop/withdrawal protocols)**.** Detection and routing are operationalized in [Readiness Probes](readiness-probes.md).   
### Relations (Wiring)   
**Architectural Position:**   
- **Gates Entry To:** [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md); [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)   
- **Assessed By:** [Readiness Probes](readiness-probes.md)   
- **Scaffolded By:** [Cognitive Mirror](cognitive-mirror-protege-mode.md) (Layer 2, Zone B)   
   
**Layer Mappings:**   
- **Layer 1 → :** Viability Envelope; [Holding Environment](holding-environment.md); [Protected Self-Holding Principle](protected-self-holding-principle.md)   
- **Layer 2** → : Axis A + B maintenance; RPVL (continuous verification); [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) (local acceptance gate); [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md)   
   
**Constrained By:** Protected Self-Holding Principle
**Failure Attractors (when violated):** Category Error; PSB; [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md); Simulated Holding Environment   
### Notes   
The Zone model is for communication and research design—not for labeling individuals. Population distribution across zones is empirically unknown. This object provides structure for asking and answering the accessibility question, not definitive answers.
