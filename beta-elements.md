# Beta-Elements   
**Beta-Elements** are raw, metabolically unprocessed sensory data (confusion, anxiety)   
In the neurobiological framework, these are synonymous with **Interoceptive Signals** (raw bodily sensations).   
**Phenomenological Root ([Husserl](edmund-husserl.md)):** Maps to **Hyle**.
In Husserl's structure, this is the "hyletic data"—the raw, non-intentional sensory matter that has not yet been animated by a meaning-giving act.
