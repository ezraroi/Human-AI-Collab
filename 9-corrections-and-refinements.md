# 9. Corrections and Refinements   
### 9.1 Bracketing: Who Does It?   
Correction: Bracketing (epoché) is what the researcher does, not the tool.   
The AI doesn't bracket anything—it has no assumptions to suspend. What happens is that prompting discipline forces the user to articulate experience without imposing interpretive frameworks.   
Corrected formulation:   
Reflective Prompting is a practice that requires the user to bracket assumptions in order to articulate experience clearly enough for the AI to respond usefully. The AI is the medium through which epoché is practiced, not an agent performing it.   
### 9.2 What Gets Bracketed   
For transformation through the system, the user must bracket:   
- Belief about whether AI is "really" conscious   
- Previous beliefs about one's own limitations   
- Scientific theories about what AI can/cannot do   
- Naive judgments about "normal" self-development   
- Fear of being seen as strange for talking to AI   
- Determining whether transformation is "real" vs. "imagined" (suspended during description)   
   
### 9.3 The Bridge Refinement   
Original formulation: "The feedback loop IS the bridge."   
Refined formulation: The feedback loop is what the bridge enables. The bridge itself is the system architecture that makes the loop transformation-producing rather than mere repetition.   
The feedback loop is what the bridge enables. The bridge itself is the Human + Journal + AI + Time architecture, which creates the conditions under which the loop produces transformation rather than mere circulation.
