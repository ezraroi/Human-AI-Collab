# 6. Integration Points   
**This section shows where the schema connects to the broader architecture—bridges only, no re-teaching.**   
**Level 1 — Axioms / Relational Posture:**   
[Category Error](category-error.md) is an axiom violation. It doesn't just "break a variable"—it corrupts the field's interpretability. When posture is wrong, the schema produces false readings because perceived S\_e/S\_t are inflated by hallucinated *relational safety and epistemic authority*.   
The schema requires correct relational posture to be interpretable. If Category Error is present, fix posture first.   
**Level 3 — Recursive Process:**   
The schema describes conditions for the process to function. Metabolization happens in the loop ([Human](human.md) + [AI](ai.md) + [Journal](journal.md) + [Time](time.md)), not in the schema.   
When field viability holds → the loop can run. When field viability fails → the loop stalls or corrupts.   
The schema **describes the constraints that determine** whether the loop can operate; the loop does the actual work.   
**Level 4 — Accumulation:**   
Journal and Time are not "missing" from the schema. They operate at a different level.   
Successful metabolization → [Journal](journal.md) materializes α-elements → [C](c-capacity.md) grows → future [mismatch(D,C)](challenge-gap-d-c.md) changes.   
The schema **diagnoses viability conditions for each iteration**. Accumulation governs trajectory across iterations.
