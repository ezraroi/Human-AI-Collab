# 3. The Felt Sense as the Insula (The Feedback Loop)   
Notebook 2 identified the Felt Sense ("spacious vs. tight") as the feedback loop for the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md). Notebook 4 gives this loop a physical address.   
- The Mapping: The [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) is the conscious readout of the [Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md), a key hub of the Salience Network (SN) [cite: 451, 888-889, 2216].   
- The Mechanism: The AIC is central to Interoception (sensing the body's internal state) and Prediction Error detection [cite: 889, 899].   
- A "tight" feeling is the AIC/SN detecting a "cognitive conflict" or "prediction error"—a mismatch between the AI's text and your internal model. It is the biological signal for "incoherence."   
- A "spacious" feeling is the "Felt Shift"—the biological signal of resolution, where the [AIC](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md) registers that the conflict has been resolved and the new insight can be integrated.
