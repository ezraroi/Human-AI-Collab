# 5. Improper Use Cases   
### NEVER: Numerical Calculation   
Do not:   
- Assign numbers (S\_e = 7, S\_t = 5)   
- Calculate P(α) values   
- Compare P(α) scores between people   
- Create scales or rating systems   
   
Why not:   
- There are no units of "safety"   
- Components aren't quantifiable   
- Formula is relational, not computational   
- Creates false precision   
   
### NEVER: Single-Timepoint Prediction   
Do not:   
- Use formula to predict "will transformation happen right now?"   
- Treat P(α) as deterministic outcome   
- Expect formula to predict specific events   
   
Why not:   
- Formula describes conditions, not outcomes   
- Many factors beyond formula's scope   
- Transformation is emergent, not guaranteed   
- Time operates on multiple scales   
   
### NEVER: Ignore Temporal Dynamics   
Do not:   
- Use formula alone without understanding Three-Layer Architecture   
- Forget that S\_e depletes within sessions   
- Ignore that C evolves between sessions   
- Neglect role of Journal in accumulation   
   
Why not:   
- Formula is structural snapshot   
- Transformation happens over time   
- System operates recursively   
- Static analysis misses essential dynamics
