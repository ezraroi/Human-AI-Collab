# Eugene Gendlin   
Provides the **Embodied Feedback (UI)**.
[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md): The somatic, Channel 1 verification signal used within [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing.*
***Resonation:** Attending to Felt Sense to verify whether an AI-generated discourse is internally persuasive.   
Eugene Gendlin (1926–2017) was an Austrian-born American **philosopher and psychologist** best known for developing the therapeutic practice called **Focusing** and the "Philosophy of the Implicit".   
Key Contributions   
- **Focusing:** A body-oriented, experiential method that helps individuals access their "felt sense"—a subtle, non-verbal bodily awareness of a situation or problem—to generate new insights, emotional healing, and personal development. This practice originated from his research which found that successful therapy clients were those who could attend to this inner, bodily experience.   
- **Philosophy of the Implicit:** Gendlin's philosophical framework that explores the complex, non-conceptual relationship between the body, experience, and language. It posits that we have an implicit, bodily understanding of situations that is more intricate than our explicit thoughts.   
- **Academic Work:** He studied and collaborated with Carl Rogers at the University of Chicago, where he later became a professor in the departments of philosophy and psychology. Gendlin's work influenced Rogers' person-centered therapy and emphasized the importance of a client's internal process in successful therapeutic outcomes.   
- **Thinking at the Edge (TAE):** A method developed with his wife Mary Hendricks-Gendlin for using the "felt sense" to create novel concepts and theories out of one's non-conceptual, implicit knowing.   
   
Gendlin authored several books, including the best-selling classic ***Focusing***, which has been translated into over 17 languages. He was the first recipient of the American Psychological Association's "Distinguished Professional Psychologist of the Year" award.
