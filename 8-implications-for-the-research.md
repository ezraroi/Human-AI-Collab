# 8. Implications for the Research   
### What This Notebook Adds to the Model   
Not theoretical content, but epistemic infrastructure:   
- Language to defend the methodology in academic discourse   
- Framework for organizing different types of claims   
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations and boundary conditions   
- Integration of documented failures as evidence rather than embarrassment   
   
### What Must Be Written   
1. **Methodology chapter** structured around the unbundled rationales (Revelatory, Longitudinal, Critical, Extreme)   
2. **Counter-evidence section** analyzing the manic episodes as boundary condition data   
3. **Verification architecture documentation** translating practices ([4Ps Protocol ](4ps-protocol.md)for within-session verification, [Journal](journal.md) infrastructure for cross-session validation) into methodological vocabulary   
4. **Explicit scope limitations** stating what is and is not being claimed   
   
### What Must Be Maintained   
The manic episodes demonstrate why:   
- Session limits are structural necessities   
- "Touch Grass Protocol" is methodological control, not self-care   
- [Metacognitive](metacognition.md) monitoring of "when not to engage" is part of the **methodological control layer**   
- The verification system requires ongoing calibration
