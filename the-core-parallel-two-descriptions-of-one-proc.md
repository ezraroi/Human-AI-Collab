# THE CORE PARALLEL: TWO DESCRIPTIONS OF ONE PROCESS   
### NoteBook 1 Framework (Psychological)   
[Beta Elements](beta-elements.md) → [Alpha Function](alpha-function.md) → [Alpha Elements](alpha-elements.md)   
- Beta elements: Raw, unprocessed experience ([Bion](wilfred-bion.md))   
- Alpha function: The transformation mechanism that metabolizes [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) symbolic material through recursive oscillation with [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) embodied verification.   
    - [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) ([Piaget](e.md)): Embodied sensorimotor/interoceptive pathway (including non-Felt sense: Pre-verbal bodily knowing tverbal schemas)   
    - [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) ([Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)): Symbolic, linguistic tools   
- Alpha elements: Processed, meaningful thoughts that can be used   
   
### NoteBook 2 Framework (Neurobiological)   
nteroceptive Signals → Embodied Processing → [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (Channel 1 verification signal)   
- Interoceptive signals: Raw bodily sensations (visceral, proprioceptive)   
- Embodied processing: Brain-body simulation loops   
    - Motor simulation (reading → motor cortex activation)   
    - Emotional simulation (meaning → somatic markers)   
- [Felt sense](felt-sense.md): Pre-verbal bodily awareness of meaning used to verify internal persuasiveness   
   
THE BRIDGE: [Beta-Elements ](beta-elements.md)can be mapped neurobiologically to interoceptive signaling (as one substrate of raw experiential material). The Alpha Function maps to the metabolic integration that uses embodied processing alongside symbolic material. [Alpha-Elements](alpha-elements.md) are metabolized meanings that are thinkable and verified through [Felt Sense.](felt-sense.md)
