# THE CORE PARALLEL: TWO DESCRIPTIONS OF ONE PROCESS   
### NoteBook 1 Framework (Psychological)   
[Beta Elements](beta-elements.md) → [Alpha Function](alpha-function.md) → [Alpha Elements](alpha-elements.md)   
- Beta elements: Raw, unprocessed experience (Bion)   
- Alpha function: The transformation mechanism operating through two channels   
    - [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (Piaget): Sensorimotor, non-verbal schemas   
    - [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (Vygotsky): Symbolic, linguistic tools   
- Alpha elements: Processed, meaningful thoughts that can be used   
   
### NoteBook 2 Framework (Neurobiological)   
Interoceptive Signals → Embodied Processing → Felt Sense   
- Interoceptive signals: Raw bodily sensations (visceral, proprioceptive)   
- Embodied processing: Brain-body simulation loops   
    - Motor simulation (reading → motor cortex activation)   
    - Emotional simulation (meaning → somatic markers)   
- [Felt sense](felt-sense.md): Pre-verbal bodily knowing that guides understanding   
   
THE BRIDGE: Beta elements ARE interoceptive signals. The alpha function IS embodied processing. Alpha elements ARE felt sense made thinkable.
