# Touch Grass Protocol   
A **withdrawal + return-to-baseline protocol** that ends (or pauses) AI-dialogue when **Emotional Scaffolding depletion markers** appear, in order to restore metabolic capacity and re-anchor validation in lived reality (A→B→A logic).   
**System Role**   
- **Recovery Architecture:** restores [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) via spacing (within-session + between-session).   
- **Boundary Enforcement:** prevents manic acceleration / collapse when the Human container is depleted.   
- **Ecological Re-anchoring:** forces "insight" back into non-digital life for persistence testing (return to baseline).   
- **Relational Re-grounding (preferred):** re-enters real interpersonal space to prevent the [AI](ai.md) from being recruited as holding substitute during Sₑ depletion, and to recalibrate the Subject/Object distinction experientially—not just conceptually.   
   
**Name Rationale (Why "Touch Grass")**
The protocol is called "Touch Grass" as a deliberately plain reminder to **return from the dialogic/analytic field to lived, physical reality**. It signals that validation and recovery require re-entering baseline life—sleep, movement, sensory grounding, ordinary interaction—so the system can **replenish Sₑ** and test whether insights **persist outside the AI container**. The name is intentionally informal to interrupt escalation and prevent "one more turn" compulsion when metacognitive control is weakening.   
**Trigger Conditions (Phenomenological Markers)**   
- Tightness / irritability / impatience   
- Reduced ambiguity tolerance; urge for premature resolution   
- Teleological drift / loss of global aim (your "myopic" risk)   
   
**Protocol Steps (minimal, replicable)**   
1. **Stop (hard boundary):** end session or enforce a cooldown window.   
2. **Return to baseline (A):** physical, non-digital activity; sensory grounding; sleep if late; and, **when available/safe, brief real human contact** (even minimal) to re-anchor relational reality.   
3. **No new theory-making:** prohibit "one more insight" loops during depletion.   
4. **Re-entry rule:** only resume when Sₑ markers reverse (spaciousness returns) and aim is re-stated.   
   
**Outputs**   
- Restored Sₑ capacity   
- A cleaner next session (less [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk, better [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) availability)   
- A natural test of which insights persist outside the dialogic field   
- **Recalibrated Subject/Object distinction** (what real Subjects feel like vs. [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md))   
   
**Failure Mode**   
- Skipping withdrawal → Sₑ → 0 pattern → acceleration/collapse dynamics (your manic boundary condition framing).   
- **Relational variant:** using AI as comfort-holder during depletion → Category Error stabilization → PSB vulnerability on return.   
   
**Relations (Wiring)**   
- **Depends On:** [Metacognition](metacognition.md) (monitoring + regulation)   
- **Restores:** [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)   
- **Required By:** [Time](time.md) (within-session scale)   
- **Protects Against:** collapse/acceleration states; PSB-adjacent "high-velocity" bypass risk; **Category Error stabilization during depletion**   
- **Methodological Analog:** [ABA](aba-design.md) withdrawal/return-to-baseline logic
