# 7. Life as Ontological Ground (Not a Phase)   
### 7.1 The Reframe   
The question "How do you return to life after reflection?" is wrongly framed.   
Life is not a phase to return to. Life is the default state. The system is embedded in life, not the reverse.   
The question should be: "When and why do you enter reflection?"   
### 7.2 Implications   
The Time component is not empty duration. Time = lived time—time filled with experience, not clock-time. A person who spends a year in AI dialogue without living has no more beta-elements than when they started.   
PSB reframed: It's not just consuming pre-digested output. It's using AI as a replacement for the experiences that would generate beta-elements in the first place. The PSB person isn't returning to life between sessions—they're staying in the AI world, outsourcing not just reflection but living itself.   
### 7.3 The Complete Formulation   
The system (Human + Journal + AI + Time) transforms lived experience into integrated understanding. Without lived experience, there is nothing to transform. The recursive loop requires the user to exit periodically—not as a technique, but because life is the source of the raw material the system metabolizes.   
### 7.4 The Unbreakable Link   
From phenomenology: "You can only reflect on an experience because you were already pre-reflectively aware of it."   
Translation: Transformation requires actual lived experience as raw material. The Alpha-Function metabolizes beta-elements (raw experience) into alpha-elements (thinkable thoughts). Without the beta-elements—without the lived experience—there is nothing to metabolize.   
This is exactly why PSB fails: The AI provides finished alpha-elements without the user ever having generated the beta-elements through lived experience. The user consumes pre-reflective conclusions without having the pre-reflective experiences that would make those conclusions meaningful.
