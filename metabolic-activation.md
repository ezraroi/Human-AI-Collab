# Metabolic Activation   
Metabolic Activation is the **mechanism** that determines whether symbolic AI text ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)) triggers embodied friction in [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md).   
It specifies the **three necessary conditions** for disembodied symbols to become metabolically active rather than remain inert.   
### System Role   
- Determines whether Channel 1 is recruited into the [Recursive Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md).   
- Governs the threshold at which symbolic material transitions into embodied tension.   
- Controls whether [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) can engage in genuine transformation.   
- Explains why some AI output leads to insight and other output produces nothing.   
   
### The Three Activation Conditions   
1. **[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md):** The text must feel like it comes from a different mind (productive disorientation).   
2. **[ZPD](zpd.md) Alignment:** The difficulty must fall within the user's Zone of Proximal Development.   
3. **[Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md):** The content must implicate the self; the body engages when meaning becomes personal.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Triggers:** [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)(Sensorimotor Pathway)   
- **Enables:** [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)   
- **Feeds:** [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md)   
- **Failure Mode:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (when activation conditions are absent)
