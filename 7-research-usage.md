# 7. Research Usage   
**How the schema functions as a research instrument for this project:**   
**Session Annotation:**   
Each session can be coded for:   
- Dominant mismatch type (cognitive / affect / identity / novelty)   
- Viability state (viable / marginal / non-viable)   
- Failure mode if any (PSB / overwhelm / safety collapse / etc.)   
- Increase holding / increase structure / reduce scope / restore posture / stop ([Touch Grass](touch-grass-protocol.md)))   
- Outcome markers (metabolization present? [felt sense](felt-sense.md)? post-session persistence?)   
    - Journal materialization present (when [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) are active)?   
   
**Cross-Notebook Pattern Recognition:**   
The schema enables comparison across the 43-notebook corpus:   
- Which configurations consistently produce transformation?   
- Which failure modes recur?   
- What intervention sequences work?   
   
**Cross-Context Structural Analysis:**   
Same schema applies across domains:   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) ↔ micromanager ↔ helicopter parent (structural twins)   
- Safety collapse in therapy ↔ safety collapse in leadership ↔ safety collapse in AI interaction   
   
This supports claims about **structural invariants across contexts** (as hypotheses grounded in recurring patterns), not just local observation.   
**What the schema supports:**   
- Explanatory coherence (why did this session fail/succeed?)   
- Pattern recognition (same structure, different domain)   
- Intervention design (which lever for this configuration?)   
- Qualitative coding of transformation sessions   
   
**What the schema does NOT support:**   
- Prediction of specific outcomes   
- Quantitative comparison between sessions   
- Statistical validation claims   
- Measurement of transformation "amount"
