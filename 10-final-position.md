# 10. Final Position   
The Defensible Claim: This study provides detailed mechanism identification through temporal density, tested against psychoanalytic theory, with documented boundary conditions and failures, seeking analytic generalization to theoretical propositions rather than statistical generalization to populations.   
The Explicit Limitation: The patterns identified may not generalize to other individuals' transformations. The study proves possibility and identifies mechanism; it does not prove frequency or population-level effects.   
The Contribution: Opening a research program where others can test these mechanisms in their own contexts, with procedural documentation sufficient for replication attempts.
