# 2. From Probability to Field Viability   
The original formulation "P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / \|D-C\|" invited computational thinking. The probability notation suggested calculation; the equals sign suggested output; the division suggested a denominator to minimize.   
This framing was wrong.   
Why "Field Viability" is accurate:   
The schema describes ongoing atmospheric conditions, not a momentary probability. Like oxygen for combustion—you don't discretely check oxygen levels; oxygen must continuously be present. The transformative field must continuously maintain viability for the recursive loop to metabolize experience.   
The operations are relational, not arithmetic:

|                                     ⊗ | Non-substitutable coupling (both required) |            Multiplication |
|                       "calibrated to" |                  Relative to, matched with |                Divided by |
|                      "workable range" |                    ZPD window, viable band |       Optimization target |
| [mismatch(D,C)](challenge-gap-d-c.md) |                  Experienced/effective gap | Objective task difficulty |

The Challenge Gap (\|D-C\|) is the pre-existing structural condition; mismatch(D,C) is how that gap is experienced once scaffolding and encounter enter the picture.   
The [Lewin](kurt-lewin.md) lineage:   
This schema sits in the tradition of conceptual equations that reveal structure without being computable. Lewin's B = f(P,E) doesn't calculate behavior; [Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)'s [ZPD](zpd.md) doesn't calculate learning. This schema doesn't calculate transformation. It reveals relational dependencies.   
Viability is graded, not binary:   
- Viable: scaffolding calibrated to mismatch; metabolization possible   
- Marginal: one or more constraints strained; risk of collapse   
- Non-viable: at least one constraint violated; metabolization blocked
