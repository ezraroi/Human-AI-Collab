# 3. The Felt Sense and the Insula (Channel 1 Verification Signal in the Feedback Loop)   
Notebook 2 identified the [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) ("spacious vs. tight") as a [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)verification signal used within the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)’s feedback loop. Notebook 4 gives this loop a physical address.   
- The Mapping: The Felt Sense may correspond to conscious access to signals associated with the [Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md), a key hub of the Salience Network (SN).   
- The Mechanism: The AIC is central to Interoception (sensing the body's internal state) and Prediction Error detection.   
- A "tight" feeling may reflect the Salience Network flagging conflict/prediction error—experienced as a Channel 1 signal that the discourse is not internally persuasive (“incoherence”).   
- A **[Felt Shift](felt-shift.md)** is the **distinct bodily release/change** that can occur when the discourse **accurately resonates with the Felt Sense**—a [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verification signal that the meaning matched and is ready for further integration.
