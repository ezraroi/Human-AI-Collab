Jean Piaget (1896-1980) was a highly influential Swiss psychologist and biologist, widely recognized as a pioneer of **developmental child psychology**. His work fundamentally changed the understanding that children think differently from adults, proposing instead that they are active, "little scientists" who construct their own knowledge through interactions with their environment.   
Key Contributions   
- **Theory of Cognitive Development:** Piaget is best known for his theory that children universally progress through four sequential stages of intellectual growth:   
    - **Sensorimotor Stage** (birth to approx. age 2): Learning through senses and motor actions, developing object permanence (understanding objects still exist when out of sight).   
    - **Preoperational Stage** (approx. ages 2 to 7): Development of language and symbolic thought (play-acting, imagination), though thinking is often egocentric (difficulty seeing others' perspectives).   
    - **Concrete Operational Stage** (approx. ages 7 to 11): The emergence of logical thought and understanding of concepts like conservation and classification, but reasoning is limited to concrete objects and events.   
    - **Formal Operational Stage** (approx. age 12 and up): The development of abstract reasoning, hypothetical thinking, and complex problem-solving abilities.   
- **Constructivism:** He introduced the theory that children actively build their understanding of the world, rather than passively receiving information, a concept that has deeply influenced modern education.   
- **Genetic Epistemology:** Piaget coined this term for the study of the origins of knowledge, bridging his interests in biology and philosophy to understand how knowledge develops across childhood.   
   
His research and ideas continue to influence fields beyond psychology, including education, sociology, and philosophy, advocating for child-centered and discovery-based learning environments.
