# 4. The Tactical Layer: The 4Ps as Metacognitive Loop   
We can now map the 4Ps Protocol directly to the cognitive science of metacognition:   
- PAUSE (Inhibition): Stops System 1 (Automatic Thinking). Prevents the "[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)" reflex of passive consumption.   
- PROBE (Monitoring): Uses Externalization to make invisible thinking visible. The AI's "Functional Alterity" provides the surface against which thoughts are projected or the user probes themself not using the AI.   
- PROCESS (Control): Engages [Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md). The user repairs their mental model through the struggle to articulate it to the AI or with themself.   
- POSSESS (Evaluation): Uses Decision Justification and Somatic Verification. The insight is checked against the Felt Sense ("Spacious vs. Tight") and can be inscribed in the Journal ([Chronotope](chronotope.md)) to ensure ownership if this is a final meaningful artifact (something you learned about yourself).
