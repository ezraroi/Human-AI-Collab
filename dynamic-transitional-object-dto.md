# Dynamic Transitional Object (DTO)   
**Definition:** A "Responsive Generative Artifact" that occupies the potential space between inner reality and the external world. It acts as a "not-me" object that simulates responsiveness without subjective consciousness.   
**Key Function:** It acts as a "Productive Fiction," simulating social presence just enough to activate [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) & [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) without collapsing into a [False Self](false-self.md) relationship.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[AI](ai.md)** (Relation: `Ontological Classification Of`).   
- Link to **[Potential Space](potential-space.md)** (Relation: `Occupies`).   
- Link to **[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)** (Relation: `Validates`).
