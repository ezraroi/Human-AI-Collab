# Diachronic Alterity   
The functional otherness provided by one’s own prior metabolized inscriptions ([Journal](journal.md) entries), enabling internal dialogue across time by making past-self positions addressable as an “other.” Diachronic Alterity prevents episodic cognition by turning return into encounter (re-entry as dialogue rather than reset).   
### System Role   
- Enables continuity as **polyphony**: present-self can relate to past-self as a distinct I-position.   
- Provides the diachronic complement to [AI](ai.md)’s synchronic alterity: the system has *two* alterity poles (now vs across time).   
- Supports durable [capacity](c-capacity.md) growth by making prior metabolization re-enterable and comparable (necessary for trajectory, not just session coherence).   
   
### Mechanism   
- **Re-entry encounter:** returning to a prior entry generates productive difference between (past position) and (current position).   
- **Addressability:** the entry functions as a stable reference point that can be affirmed, revised, or revoked without erasing the trajectory.   
- **Stability requirement:** works only when inscriptions are owned-language and produced under verification; AI-heavy or borrowed entries weaken alterity (they become AI-echo rather than past-self).   
   
### Distinctions   
- Not Functional Alterity: not turn-by-turn constraint production; not AI output.   
- Not “memory”: it is an **addressable position**, not recall.   
- Not ontological “otherness”: it is **functional** (no personification of past-self required).   
   
### Relations   
- Provided By → [Journal](journal.md)   
- Complements → [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) (AI)   
- Enables → [Chronotope](chronotope.md) (as addressable return), Macro-verification (maintenance), [Selected Facts](selected-fact.md) / RPVL probation across T+n   
- Helps prevent → Episodic cognition; Transient Insight / Pseudo-Integration   
- Depends On → Verification (micro during creation); Owned language / idiom integrity   
- Level → Macro (Diachronic); Functional Alterity is Micro (Utterance)
