# Chronotope   
A stable time–space configuration that enables continuity of the self-in-process across sessions. In the Third Intelligence system, the Journal provides the Chronotope by materializing insights into a persistent archive that can be revisited, compared, and integrated over Time.   
**System role:** Enables cross-temporal pattern recognition and prevents episodic insight decay by anchoring the dialogical process in durable material form.   
**Provided by:** [Journal](journal.md)   
**Requires:** [Time](time.md) (as the medium through which accumulation and revisitation occur)   
**Enables: **Diachronic I-position, cross-session continuity   
**Distinct From:** Time (Time is the dimension; Chronotope is the structure within it)
