# High-Resolution Uncertainty   
**Definition:** The state of "Negative Capability" where the user can sustain the tension of complex ambiguity without collapsing. It distinguishes "Productive Doubt" (I see the nuance) from "Destructive Doubt" (I am lost) .   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Negative Capability](negative-capability.md)** (Relation: `Refinement Of`).   
- Link to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** (Relation: `Antidote To`).   
- Link to **[Metacognitive](metacognition.md) Monitoring** (Relation: `Goal Of`).   
   
**Notes:** Cognitive tolerance of ambiguity; refined Negative Capability.
