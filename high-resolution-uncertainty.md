# High-Resolution Uncertainty   
High-Resolution Uncertainty is a [metacognitive](metacognition.md) state where the user maintains granular awareness of what they know and don't know, and can regulate their inquiry without premature closure while tolerating unresolved ambiguity.   
This represents productive doubt: in this state, the user can see nuance, hold complexity, and sustain inquiry without collapsing into either premature closure ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) or paralysis.   
**Cognitive Basis:**   
The Underconfidence-with-Practice (UWP) Effect from metacognition research explains the counterintuitive nature of this state: as expertise grows, confidence often drops while accuracy improves. Experts recognize complexity and edge cases that novices miss, producing the phenomenology of "knowing more → feeling less certain."   
This explains why High-Resolution Uncertainty is the developmental goal, not high confidence. The system cultivates productive doubt (high resolution: "I see the nuance, it's complex") rather than either:   
- **Destructive doubt** (low resolution: "I'm lost, overwhelmed")   
- **False certainty** ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md): "This is obviously clear," but accuracy is low)   
   
**Relations:**   
- Link to [Negative Capability](negative-capability.md) (Relation: Refinement Of — Negative Capability is the underlying capacity that makes sustaining this state tolerable).

- Link to **[Metacognitive](metacognition.md) Monitoring** (Relation: `Goal Of`).
