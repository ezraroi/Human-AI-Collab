# 3.The Mechanism vs. Existence Distinction   
### What Is Actually Being Claimed?   
The diagnostic formula P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / \|D-C\| is a mechanism claim, not merely existence proof. This requires different evidence standards.

|    Claim Type |                                          Statement |                                 Evidence Required |
|     Existence |       "Transformation via AI dialogue is possible" |             Single documented instance sufficient |
|     Mechanism | "When transformation occurs, it operates this way" |    Process tracing, causal pathway identification |
| Replicability |                 "Others can reproduce this method" | Procedural documentation, transferable components |

The Resolution: The study claims Analytic Generalization of mechanism - not statistical generalization to population. The argument becomes: "I have isolated the gears of this machine. I cannot prove this machine exists in your context, but I have proven that these gears, assembled this way, produce this motion."
