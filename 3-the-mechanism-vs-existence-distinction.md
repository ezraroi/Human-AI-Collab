# 3.The Mechanism vs. Existence Distinction   
### What Is Actually Being Claimed?   
The Third Intelligence system operates through identifiable causal dynamics. The diagnostic formula [P(alpha)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md) = (S\_e × S\_t) / \|[D-C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| provides a predictive model of these dynamics, enabling process tracing and causal pathway identification rather than mere existence proof.   
|        Claim Type |                                                  Statement |                                 Evidence Required |
|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|     **Existence** |               "Transformation via AI dialogue is possible" |             Single documented instance sufficient |
|     **Mechanism** | "When transformation occurs, the system operates this way" |    Process tracing, causal pathway identification |
| **Replicability** |                         "Others can reproduce this method" | Procedural documentation, transferable components |

**The Resolution**: The study claims [Analytic Generalization](analytic-generalization.md) of mechanism - not statistical generalization to population. The argument becomes: "I have isolated the gears of this machine. I cannot prove this machine exists in your context, but I have proven that these gears, assembled this way, produce this motion."
