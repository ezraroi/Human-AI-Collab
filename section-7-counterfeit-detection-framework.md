# Section 7 — Counterfeit Detection Framework   
This notebook provides a defensible way to separate [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) events from their most dangerous mimics: moments of "pretty coherence" that feel organizing but function as defensive closure. In the context of AI-mediated dialogue, this distinction is non-negotiable because fluent language can simulate integration while bypassing metabolic change.   
**Primary counterfeits**   
The notebook identifies a family of counterfeit coherence patterns that can masquerade as Selected Fact:   
1. **Narrative closure:** coherence that feels complete because it closes inquiry, not because it reorganizes the underlying material.   
2. **Intellectualization / verbal fluency:** articulate linkage without affective reality, embodied uptake, or expansion of what is thinkable and actionable.   
3. **Overvalued certainty:** rapid conviction that substitutes certainty for digestion and bypasses frustration tolerance.   
4. **Premature meaning:** forcing a unifying frame before material has become metabolizable, producing pseudo-integration.   
   
These counterfeits are especially relevant in [AI](ai.md) contexts because the system can readily supply coherent stories and satisfying frames ([Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)), increasing the risk of mistaking fluency for transformation—particularly when symbolic coherence is adopted without digestion ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk).   
**Diagnostic markers of genuine Selected Fact**   
The notebook locks four criteria that distinguish genuine Selected Fact from counterfeit coherence. These markers correspond to the temporal validation criteria established in Section 5. A Selected Fact is classified as genuine only when it shows:   
1. **Resonance (candidate marker):** a felt signature that coherence has been discovered—metabolically compelling, not merely cognitive agreement.   
2. **Actionability:** it changes what becomes possible—new choices, boundaries, decisions, or [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C).   
3. **Embodied uptake (integration marker):** the coherence is integrated into affect and action, not only described or understood.   
4. **Temporal persistence:** it survives return and deepens across T+n rather than fading after the moment.   
   
**The verification rule**   
A coherence event is treated as a candidate Selected Fact at time T and is upgraded to Selected Fact status only after probationary testing:   
- If it persists, deepens, and increases Capacity (C) across time → genuine   
- If it collapses into mere story, certainty, or fluency on return → counterfeit   
   
This counterfeit framework is not an ancillary safeguard; it is a core methodological requirement. It protects the research against self-legitimating narratives, prevents AI-induced closure from being misread as transformation, and provides a repeatable criterion for corpus analysis.
