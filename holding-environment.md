# Holding Environment   
The **Holding Environment** is a core concept developed by [Donald Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md), defined simply and shortly as:   
A **safe, consistent, and nurturing context** (also known as the facilitating environment) that represents the **total environmental provision** offered by the caregiver, usually the mother. This environment primarily concerns itself with the individual's **being** (an ontological concept).   
The function of the holding environment is to enable the infant's emotional development by safeguarding their **continuity-of-being** and facilitating the capacity to integrate experience and develop the essential sense of **"I am me"**.   
In the context of psychoanalytic treatment, the **analyst's attention and consistent setting**—including interpretative work, empathy, and reliability—serve to create this protective holding environment   
### In my context:   
**Definition:** The non-negotiable prerequisite of psychological safety (represented by **[$S\_e$](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md)**).   
**Function:** Protects the psyche from impingement, allowing the "[True Self](true-self.md)" to emerge.
