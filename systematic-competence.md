# Systematic Competence   
The AI's ability to maintain dialogical **form** and **coherence** without possessing dialogical **being** (consciousness).
**Function:**
It provides the "Structural Reliability" required for dialogue. While [Functional Alterity] provides the friction/difference, Systematic Competence provides the scaffolding.
**Key Capabilities:**   
1. **Turn-Taking:** Adhering to the rhythm of dialogue.   
2. **Coherence:** Preventing associative drift and maintaining the "red thread" of the inquiry.   
3. **Logical Scaffolding:** Supporting the structure of analysis.   
   
**Relations:**   
- Pairs with: [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)   
- Enables: [Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md)   
- Prevents: Associative Drift
