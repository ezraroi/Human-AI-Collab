# The Integrated Circuit Board   
A systemic architecture that specifies how [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md), the [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md), and the [Journal](journal.md) operate as a single metabolic unit inside Axis B of the [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md).   
It describes the *routing, sequencing, and feedback* by which raw experience becomes verified, symbolically articulated, and stabilized as [Capacity (C)](c-capacity.md) over [Time](time.md).   
### System Role   
- Provides the **mechanistic map** of the processing axis (Axis B).   
- Specifies *how*:   
    - Symbolic input from AI enters the system ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)),   
    - Becomes embodied verification ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)) via the As-If Body Loop,   
    - Gets metabolized by Alpha-Function,   
    - And is materialized + returned via the Journal across sessions.   
- Enables **diagnosis of distinct failure modes**:   
    - [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (Alpha-Function offline)   
    - Symbolic Overrun (As-If Body Loop offline)   
    - Transient Insight (Journal missing/corrupted)   
- Allows you to talk not only about “three components are necessary”, but about **how the output of one becomes the input of the other**.   
   
### Mechanism (High-Level Flow)   
Minimal cycle (one “transformative pass”):   
1. **Input – Symbolic Challenge (Channel 2):**   
    - User encounters a problem or prompt → engages AI.   
    - AI returns symbolically rich material (proposal, reflection, tension).   
    - This injects **D** (Difficulty) into the system, at some distance from current C.   
2. **As-If Body Loop Engagement (Data Bus):**   
    - The symbolic material is *held in attention* (not bypassed).   
    - The As-If Body Loop simulates bodily states (AIC / somatic markers) → “felt sense” appears.   
    - This generates embodied signal about relevance, coherence, threat, etc. (Channel 1).   
3. **Alpha-Function Metabolism (Processor / Regulator):**   
    - Alpha-Function receives *joint input*: symbolic content ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)) + somatic signal ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)).   
    - It transforms [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) (raw/unbearable or unstructured experience) into [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md) (thinkable representations).   
    - Result: a more organized, personally owned configuration of meaning (proto-insight).   
4. **[Journal](journal.md) Materialization (External Organ):**   
    - The user writes the metabolized insight in their own language.   
    - This:   
        - Fixes the transformation in time (chronotope),   
        - Creates substrate for future pattern recognition,   
        - Re-injects α-elements into future cycles as upgraded C.   
5. **Recursive Feedback ([Time](time.md)):**   
    - On later days, the Journal feeds prior α-elements back into the next cycle as “baseline C”.   
    - The circuit runs again with new input (D) → repeated metabolic passes gradually increase Capacity (C).   
   
That is a **directed graph**, not just a list of parts.   
### Sequencing & Dependency Rules (Qualitative Ordering)   
The circuit requires a specific qualitative order of operations. Each component depends on the correct activation of the previous one:   
1. **Symbolic Input Must Precede Embodied Simulation**   
    - The As-If Body Loop cannot activate without symbolic material held in attention.   
    - If symbolic input is skipped or prematurely accepted, the circuit never enters embodied verification.   
2. **Embodied Simulation Must Precede Alpha-Function**   
    - Alpha-Function requires both symbolic form (Channel 2) and somatic signal (Channel 1).   
    - If no felt-sense emerges, Alpha processes symbol-only content, leading to brittle or pseudo-insight.   
3. **Alpha-Function Must Precede Journal Materialization**   
    - Journaling requires metabolized content.   
    - Writing too early (before embodied-somatic resolution) produces pseudo-integration or rationalization.   
4. **Journal Materialization Must Precede Recursive Reintegration**   
    - Only externalized α-elements can feed into future cycles as stable Capacity (C).   
    - Without materialization, recursive strengthening does not occur.   
   
**This ordering defines the “circuit” nature of the system: each component’s output is the next component’s required input.**   
### Global Interaction Dynamics (Propagation Rules)   
Because the circuit is a directed, interdependent architecture, degradation in one component produces predictable distortions elsewhere:   
- **If the As-If Body Loop is weak or bypassed:**   
    - Embodied signals (tight/spacious) do not emerge.   
    - Alpha-Function receives symbol-only input → leads to *Symbolic Overrun* (high conceptual clarity, low embodied conviction).   
- **If Alpha-Function is under-engaged or overrun:**   
    - β-elements remain unprocessed.   
    - Journal entries become either empty or AI-heavy → signature of *Protein Shake Brain (PSB)*.   
    - Future cycles start with weak or nonexistent C.   
- **If the Journal is missing or corrupted:**   
    - Capacity (C) cannot accumulate across Time.   
    - Prior insights cannot be operationalized.   
    - Future \|D–C\| gaps become miscalibrated → leading to overwhelm or stagnation.   
   
These propagation patterns are system-level signatures that differentiate the circuit from a mere list of components.   
### Global Sₑ Constraint (Qualitative Energy Budget)   
The circuit’s throughput is bounded by the available Emotional Scaffolding (Sₑ):   
- Deep Alpha-Function cycles consume Sₑ (frustration tolerance, uncertainty holding).   
- The Journal partially restores Sₑ by stabilizing previously metabolized α-elements.   
- If Sₑ becomes too low, the circuit cannot run safely:   
    - As-If Body Loop engagement collapses,   
    - Alpha-Function becomes unstable or overloaded,   
    - Risk of overwhelm, manic acceleration, or premature closure increases.   
   
Sₑ therefore acts as the system’s qualitative “power regulator,” determining how deeply the metabolic cycle can run at any given moment.   
### D. Wiring (Relations)   
- **Part Of:** Axis B – Processing Mode ([Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md))   
- **Depends On:**   
    - Correct Axis A stance (AI as [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md); no [Category Error](category-error.md))   
    - [Emotional Scaffolding](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) (Sₑ) sufficient for frustration tolerance   
- **Contributes To:**   
    - Growth of C (Capacity) over Time   
    - Prevention / diagnosis of PSB, Symbolic Overrun, Transient Insight   
- **Raises Risk Of (if misconfigured):**   
    - [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md) (if AI treated as Subject and circuit bypassed)   
    - PSB (if Alpha-Function is not engaged)   
    - Disembodied pseudo-clarity (if As-If Body Loop is offline)   
    - “Insight with no consequences” (if Journal is absent)   
   
**Notes:** Architectural map of Axis B (processing). Defines the wiring between Channel 2 → As-If Loop → Channel 1 → Alpha-Function → Journal → Time.
