# The Integrated Circuit Board   
### Architectural Framing   
The Integrated Circuit Board is a **qualitative wiring heuristic** for Axis B. It specifies coupling requirements, dependency constraints, and failure propagation in the human transformation process. It does not claim computational determinism, nor a measurable neurocircuit.   
> Explanation: This bounding paragraph is placed first to prevent literalist misreading. It establishes the metaphor's scope before describing the mechanism.   

A systemic architecture that specifies how [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) and the [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) perform metabolic processing, and how the [Journal](journal.md) conditionally materializes outcomes for durable re-entry inside Axis B of the [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md).
It describes the *coupling, routing, and feedback* by which raw experience becomes verified, symbolically articulated, and — when materialized — stabilized as [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) over Time.   
### System Role   
- Provides the **architectural map** of the processing axis (Axis B).   
- Specifies *how*:   
    - Symbolic input from AI enters the system ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md))   
    - Recruits embodied verification ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)) via the As-If Body Loop   
    - Gets metabolized by Alpha-Function through recursive oscillation   
    - And may be materialized via the Journal across sessions   
- Enables **diagnosis of distinct failure modes**:   
    - [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (C1 ↔ C2 coupling systematically absent)   
    - Symbolic Overrun (As-If Body Loop weak or offline)   
    - Transient Insight ([Journal](journal.md) missing when durable growth needed)   
- Allows you to talk not only about "three components are necessary", but about **how they must couple for metabolism to occur**.   
   
### Core Invariant: Coupling, Not Sequence   
The circuit's operative requirement is **coupling**: Channel 2 (symbolic material) and Channel 1 (embodied signal) must talk to each other during Alpha-Function processing. The "direction" describes dependency and failure propagation, not mandated temporal order.   
> Explanation: This replaces the rigid "must precede" language. Coupling is the invariant; sequence is a typical trace, not a gate structure.   

### Mechanism (High-Level Flow)   
One metabolic pass through the circuit:   
1. **Entry — Tension or Symbolic Challenge:**   
    - Entry can occur via either channel:   
        - **C1 → C2 (typical at session initiation):** Felt tension/ache seeks externalization and symbolization through AI engagement   
        - **C2 → C1 (typical mid-session):** AI provides symbolic material requiring embodied verification   
    - What matters is that both channels become engaged, not which fires first.   
   
> Explanation: Your lived experience shows session-phase dependency. Entry direction shifts based on where you are in the session arc.   

1. **As-If Body Loop Engagement (Channel Bridge):**   
    - Symbolic material is *held in attention* (not bypassed or prematurely accepted).   
    - The As-If Body Loop simulates bodily states (AIC / somatic markers) → "felt sense" appears.   
    - This generates embodied signal about relevance, coherence, threat, etc. (Channel 1).   
    - The signal may confirm, resist, or complexify the symbolic content.   
2. **Alpha-Function Metabolism (Recursive Oscillation):**   
    - Alpha-Function metabolizes through **C2 ↔ C1 oscillation** — not linear processing.   
    - Symbolic content is checked against somatic signal; somatic signal is articulated through symbolic refinement.   
    - The oscillation continues until:   
        - A stable α-element forms (Full Pass), or   
        - Contact increases without crystallization (Proximity Pass), or   
        - Coupling fails to stabilize (Abandoned Pass)   
    - Result: a more organized, personally owned configuration — or increased contact with what remains unnamed.   
3. **Journal Materialization (External Organ — Conditional):**   
    - When a discrete insight crystallizes, the user writes in their own language.   
    - This:   
        - Fixes the transformation in time (chronotope),   
        - Creates substrate for future pattern recognition,   
        - Carries materialized, metabolized content into future cycles as strengthened baseline C.   
    - **Journal is not required for all valid passes.** Proximity Passes may leave no formal entry; the conversation history itself may serve as weak substrate.   
   
> Explanation: This reflects your clarification that not everything is "deep enough" for a journal entry. The Journal is essential for durable growth but not for all valuable processing.   

1. **Recursive Feedback ([Time](time.md)):**   
    - On later days, the Journal (or persistent conversation context) feeds prior material back into the next cycle.   
    - The circuit runs again with new input → repeated passes may gradually increase Capacity (C).   
    - Proximity Passes without Journal may still shift structural readiness, but with less durability.   
   
### Pass Types (Valid Circuit Completions)   
The circuit can complete in three ways:   
|                            Pass Type |                                                 Coupling |                                                   Output |                                                           Journal |                                                                             Capacity Effect |
|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Metabolic Pass (Full Click)** |                           C1 ↔ C2 oscillation stabilizes |                                   Discrete owned insight |                                   Yes — captures what became true |                              Durable C growth via stored [alpha-element](alpha-elements.md) |
|   **Proximity Pass (Partial Click)** |   C1 ↔ C2 oscillation occurred, didn't fully crystallize | Reduced distance, clearer direction, increased tolerance |   Typically no — conversation history may serve as weak substrate | Structural readiness grows (calibration, tolerance, precision), less durable than Full Pass |
|                   **Abandoned Pass** |                             Coupling failed to stabilize |                                          None or minimal |                                                                No |                                              Neutral; slightly degrading if pattern repeats |

> Explanation: This introduces "coming closer without arriving" as a first-class valid outcome. Not all transformation produces discrete insight. Proximity Passes grow structural readiness without requiring journal materialization.   

### Session-Phase Dynamics (Canonical Traces)   
The dominant flow direction shifts based on session phase:   
- **Initiation trace:** C1 → C2 → oscillation
*(Felt tension seeks symbolization through AI)*   
- **Mid-session trace:** C2 → C1 → oscillation
*(AI proposes; body verifies)*   
- **Closure trace:** oscillation → Journal (optional) → Time
*(Stabilization and re-entry substrate)*   
   
These are typical paths, not mandated sequences. The system tolerates divergence, delay, and return without penalty.   
> Explanation: This explicitly models your experience that entry is phase-dependent, and frames the traces as "typical" rather than "required."   

### Coupling Gates (Replacing Sequencing Rules)   
The circuit requires coupling, not order:   
1. **C2 and C1 must engage together during Alpha processing**   
    - If C2 runs without C1 verification → Symbolic Overrun (high clarity, low conviction)   
    - If C1 signal is present but not symbolized → Nameless dread, acting out   
    - Coupling is the test; entry point is flexible   
2. **Alpha-Function requires joint input**   
    - Symbol-only processing produces brittle pseudo-insight   
    - Soma-only processing remains unarticulated   
    - Metabolization requires both channels in recursive contact   
3. **[Materialization](materialization.md) requires metabolized content (when it occurs)**   
    - Journaling **without** embodied-somatic verification produces pseudo-integration   
    - But not all processing needs journaling — Proximity Passes are valid without it   
4. **Durable recursive reintegration requires external substrate**   
    - Journal provides strongest durability   
    - Persistent conversation context provides partial substrate   
    - Without either, Proximity shifts are real but more vulnerable to regression   
   
### Verification Checkpoints   
4Ps/RPVL function as checkpoints that pause the circuit to require explicit validation before treating symbolic output as owned alpha. They prevent "unverified current" from being mistaken for integrated meaning.   
> Explanation: Renamed from "circuit breaker" — these don't stop processing, they require authentication before proceeding.   

### Global Interaction Dynamics (Propagation Rules)   
Because the circuit is a directed, interdependent architecture, degradation in one component produces predictable distortions elsewhere:   
- **If the As-If Body Loop is weak or bypassed:**   
    - Embodied signals (tight/spacious) do not emerge.   
    - Alpha-Function receives symbol-only input → leads to *Symbolic Overrun* (high conceptual clarity, low embodied conviction).   
- **If Alpha-Function is under-engaged or overrun:**   
    - [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) remain unprocessed.   
    - Journal entries (if made) become AI-heavy or imitative.   
    - Future cycles start with weak or nonexistent C.   
- **If the Journal is missing when durable growth is needed:**   
    - Full Pass insights may not reliably accumulate across Time.   
    - Prior patterns cannot be recognized or operationalized.   
    - Future \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| gaps become miscalibrated.   
    - (Note: Journal absence is normal for Proximity Passes and light processing.)   
- **PSB Pattern (Diagnostic):**   
    - Repeated C2 throughput with weak C1 coupling   
    - Coupling failure is the signature, not Journal absence   
    - Distinguished from Proximity Pass by: no felt sense during conversation, smooth consumption rather than working-on-something, rapid evaporation post-session   
   
> Explanation: PSB is now clearly distinguished from Proximity Pass by coupling pattern, not journaling behavior.   

### Global Sₑ Constraint (Qualitative Energy Budget)   
The circuit's throughput is bounded by available [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ):   
- Deep Alpha-Function cycles consume Sₑ (frustration tolerance, uncertainty holding).   
- The Journal stabilizes previously materialized outcomes, reducing reprocessing load across sessions.   
- If Sₑ becomes too low, the circuit cannot run safely:   
    - As-If Body Loop engagement collapses,   
    - Alpha-Function becomes unstable or overloaded,   
    - Risk of overwhelm, manic acceleration, or premature closure increases.   
   
Sₑ therefore acts as the system's qualitative "power regulator," determining how deeply the metabolic cycle can run at any given moment.   
### Relationship to Coherence Flywheel   
The **[Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md)** describes the phenomenology of the circuit when it's engaged well — how it *feels* from inside. The relationship is complementary, not isomorphic:   
- **ICB:** Architectural constraints (what must couple for transformation to be possible)   
- **Flywheel:** Experiential dynamics (how the process feels when engaged)   
   
Flywheel stages (Spark → Spill → Mirror → Click → Mark → Recoil) do not map one-to-one onto circuit nodes. They illuminate each other without collapsing into each other.   
> Explanation: Makes explicit that these are two lenses on the same phenomenon, with deliberately loose mapping.   

### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Part Of:** Axis B — Processing Mode (Two-Axis Framework)   
- **Complemented By:** Coherence Flywheel (phenomenological view of same process)   
- **Depends On:**   
    - Correct Axis A stance (AI as [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md))   
    - Emotional Scaffolding (Sₑ) sufficient for frustration tolerance   
- **Contributes To:**   
    - Growth of C (Capacity) over Time — durable (Full Pass) or structural (Proximity Pass)   
    - Prevention / diagnosis of [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), Symbolic Overrun, Transient Insight   
- **Raises Risk Of (if misconfigured):**   
    - Cognitive Dependency (if AI treated as Subject and PSB co-occurs)   
    - PSB (if C1 ↔ C2 coupling systematically absent)   
    - Disembodied pseudo-clarity (if As-If Body Loop offline)   
    - "Insight with no consequences" (if Journal absent when durable growth needed)   
   
**Notes:** Qualitative wiring heuristic for Axis B (processing). Defines coupling requirements between C2 ↔ As-If Loop ↔ C1 ↔ Alpha-Function, with optional Journal → Time for durable accumulation. System tolerates divergence, delay, and return; coupling is the invariant, sequence is typical trace.
