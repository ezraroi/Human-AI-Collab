# 8. Common Misuses and Anti-Patterns   
### Treating it as a score   
“My [field viability](field-viability-schema.md) was higher today”—NO. The schema provides graded states (viable/marginal/non-viable) for diagnosis, not numbers for comparison. If you're comparing scores, you've drifted back to probability thinking.   
### “Optimize mismatch” thinking   
The goal is metabolization, not efficiency. “How do I maximize transformation throughput?” is the wrong question. Sometimes the right move is to slow down, reduce scope, or stop entirely. Productivity ideology is incompatible with this schema.   
### Using [S\_t](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) to bypass affect/identity load   
Adding more structure when the problem is emotional. “If I just explain it more clearly…” when the user needs safety, not clarity. Non-substitutability means this cannot work. Match scaffolding type to mismatch type.   
### Confusing felt coherence with metabolization   
Especially under the [Manic Episode](the-manic-episode.md) boundary condition. Fluent output ≠ transformed capacity. The outputs feel coherent; the user feels productive; but nothing has actually been metabolized.
Check: Does it persist post-session? Does it feel owned? Can the user reconstruct it without the AI? Was it materialized in the [Journal](journal.md) (when [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) are active)? If not, it may be counterfeit coherence.   
### Allowing [Category Error](category-error.md) to masquerade as safety   
“The [AI](ai.md) understands me” feels like high [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md). The warmth feels real. But verification is corrupted—the user is checking against hallucinated relational signals, not metabolically earned ownership.
Check: Am I skeptically verifying or passively receiving? Does this feel owned or validated?   
### Skipping [Touch Grass](touch-grass-protocol.md) when S\_e is depleted   
Pushing through when container is empty. “Just one more session…” when the schema says stop. The user hallucinates viability; actual S\_e is non-viable.
The schema diagnoses when the stop lever is required. Ignoring this recreates Manic Episode boundary conditions.
