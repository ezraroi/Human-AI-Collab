### 3.1 Embodied Evaluation: Methodological Gap   
This work claims that symbolic interaction is evaluated through embodied processes. This is:   
- theoretically plausible (supported by embodied cognition and affective neuroscience)   
- experientially observed in this case   
- structurally necessary for the model's epistemic coherence   
   
However:   
- empirical evidence for these embodied pathways remains incomplete   
- phenomenological rigor must distinguish genuine evaluative shifts from comfort or confirmation   
- the system requires a clearer falsification pathway for somatic evaluation   
   
This is a methodological gap, not a conceptual flaw.   
### 3.2 Linguistic Interaction and Embodied Verification   
The system operates:   
- symbolically in its medium   
- somatically in its verification   
- catalytically in its relational dynamics   
   
The refinement is: The system is a symbolic transformation engine with embodied governance (i.e., somatic evaluation constrains what is accepted as true and integrated)—not an embodied practice in the literal sense.
This clarifies the relationship between linguistic mediation and embodied evaluation and resolves the apparent symbolic–embodied tension.   
### 3.3 Non-Conscious vs. Human Alterity   
Notebook 11 identifies a future research question: Do non-conscious forms of alterity generate transformation profiles different from human alterity?
The model treats non-conscious alterity as functionally sufficient to supply alterity (structured difference), not equivalent to human relationality.   
This distinction must remain:   
- an open question   
- a boundary condition   
- not central to the Tier 1 mechanism claims   
   
It is a domain for future theoretical and empirical work.   
### 3.4 Rigor & Generalization Tension   
Notebook 11 emphasizes that:   
- the claims are structural and mechanistic   
- the empirical base is a rigorously documented single case (N=1)   
- phenomenological rigor—not neuroscientific inference—is the appropriate standard for evidence   
   
Therefore:   
- the theory is generalizable at the conceptual level   
- the evidence is analytic generalization grounded in one longitudinal case   
   
The epistemic boundary must be clear:
Mechanism: general theory.
Evidence: documented N=1 with rigorous internal controls.
