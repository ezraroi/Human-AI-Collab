# Conflict Detection (Model Repair)   
**Definition:** The critical process of identifying where an internal mental model contradicts reality or feedback, and then repairing it.   
**Role in System:** This is **Mode B** of the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md). It is often triggered by the AI feigning ignorance.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md)** (Relation: `Mechanism Of`).   
- Link to **[AI](ai.md)** (Relation: `Triggered by Mode B (Novice)`).   
- Link to **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** (Relation: `Signals Need For` - *Note: Conflict often feels "Tight"*).   
   
**Notes:** Mode B of Alpha-Function; triggered by AI Mode B (Novice).
