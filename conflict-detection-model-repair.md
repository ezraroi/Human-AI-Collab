# Conflict Detection (Model Repair)   
The critical process of identifying where an internal mental model contradicts reality or feedback, and then repairing it. This is **Mode B of Self-Explanation**—one of two distinct mechanisms through which [Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md) operates.   
**System Role:**   
Conflict Detection is one pathway through which the cognitive equivalent of [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (metabolic transformation) occurs. When the [AI](ai.md) adopts a "Novice" stance, it forces externalization of the user's mental model, making contradictions visible for repair.   
**Relationship to[ Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md):**   
In our integrated model, Self-Explanation (with its two modes) serves as the **cognitive science equivalent** of Bion's Alpha-Function. Both describe transformation of raw/incoherent material into organized understanding, but from different theoretical traditions:   
- **Alpha-Function (Bion):** Psychoanalytic—transforms emotional-sensory experience (β) into thinkable thoughts (α)   
- **Self-Explanation:** Cognitive science—transforms partial/contradictory knowledge into coherent understanding   
    - Mode A: Gap Filling (inference generation)   
    - Mode B: Conflict Detection (model repair)   
   
**AI Mode B: Novice/Student Stance**   
The AI adopts a "teachable novice" posture, feigning ignorance or confusion to force the user into teacher/explainer role. This operationalizes the **Protégé Effect**—teaching improves the teacher's understanding by forcing retrieval, organization, and gap identification.   
**When AI acts as Novice:**   
- Forces externalization of tacit assumptions   
- Makes mental model contradictions visible   
- Triggers Conflict Detection mechanism   
- Activates felt sense ("tight" when conflict present)   
   
**Example prompts:**   
- "I'm not following—can you explain that differently?"   
- "What do you mean by X?"   
- "How does A lead to B?"   
   
**Relations (Wiring):**   
- **Part of:** Self-Explanation (Mode B mechanism)   
- **Triggered by:** AI Mode B (Novice stance)   
- **Signals through:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (conflict often feels "Tight")   
- **Grounded in:** Protégé Effect (educational psychology)   
- **Paired with:** [Gap Filling](gap-filling-inference-generation.md) (Mode A of Self-Explanation)
