# Conflict Detection (Model Repair)   
The critical process of identifying where an internal mental model contradicts reality or feedback, and then repairing it. This is one of two distinct mechanisms through which [Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md) operates.   
**System Role:**   
Conflict Detection is one pathway through which the cognitive equivalent of [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (metabolic transformation) occurs. When the [AI](ai.md) adopts a "Novice" stance, it forces externalization of the user's mental model, making contradictions visible for repair.   
**Relationship to[ Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md):**   
In our integrated model, Self-Explanation (with its two modes) serves as the **cognitive science equivalent** of Bion's Alpha-Function. Both describe transformation of raw/incoherent material into organized understanding, but from different theoretical traditions:   
- **Alpha-Function ([Bion](wilfred-bion.md)):** Psychoanalytic—transforms emotional-sensory experience ([beta-elements](beta-elements.md)) into thinkable thoughts ([alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md))   
- **Self-Explanation:** Cognitive science—transforms partial/contradictory knowledge into coherent understanding   
    - Mode A: Gap Filling (inference generation)   
    - Mode B: Conflict Detection (model repair)   
   
**AI Mode B: Novice/Student Stance**   
The AI adopts a "teachable novice" posture, feigning ignorance or confusion to force the user into teacher/explainer role. This operationalizes the **Protégé Effect**—teaching improves the teacher's understanding by forcing retrieval, organization, and gap identification.   
**When AI acts as Novice:**   
- Forces externalization of tacit assumptions   
- Makes mental model contradictions visible   
- Triggers Conflict Detection mechanism   
- Makes [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) salient as a [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verification signal (often experienced as "tight" when discourse is not internally persuasive)   
   
**Example prompts:**   
- "I'm not following—can you explain that differently?"   
- "What do you mean by X?"   
- "How does A lead to B?"   
   
**Relations (Wiring):**   
- **Part of:** Self-Explanation (Mode B mechanism)   
- **Triggered by:** AI Mode B (Novice stance)   
- **Signals through: **Felt Sense (a Channel 1 verification signal; conflict can feel "tight")   
- **Grounded in:** Protégé Effect (educational psychology)   
- **Paired with: **[Gap Filling](gap-filling-inference-generation.md) (inference generation)
