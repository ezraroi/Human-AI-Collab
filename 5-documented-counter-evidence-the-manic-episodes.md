# 5. Documented Counter-Evidence: The Manic Episodes   
### The Critical Data Point   
The research includes documented manic episodes where:   
- Deep reflective work led to sleep deprivation   
- Subjective experience of “discovering something important”   
- Urgent desire to share findings; felt capacity to “impact the AI world”   
- Retrospective recognition of compromised judgment (“felt crazy”)   
   
### Why This Matters Methodologically   
This is precisely the counter-evidence required by [HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md) standards. It demonstrates:   
1. **The verification system can fail:** the felt-sense/embodied verification channel can become unreliable under depletion and escalating arousal, allowing grandiosity to masquerade as insight.   
2. **The model has boundary conditions:** the **[Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)** identifies collapse under extreme scaffolding depletion as a specific failure mode.   
3. **Selection effects in documentation:** the researcher recognizes, retrospectively, when the process went wrong.   
   
### Integration with the Model   
This episode represents what happens when:   
- **S\_e ([Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md))** depletes toward collapse through overuse and sleep deprivation   
- Perception of **[mismatch(D, C)](challenge-gap-d-c.md)** becomes distorted (task difficulty exceeds capacity but goes unrecognized)   
- The [Holding Environment](holding-environment.md) fails to contain the process   
- Metacognitive control (knowing when *not* to engage) breaks down   
   
**The Insight:** The manic episode is not evidence against the model—it is evidence **for** the model’s boundary conditions. When **[S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) → 0**, the schema indicates **field non-viability**, yet subjective experience can **hallucinate viability** (grandiosity). This demonstrates the schema’s explanatory power at boundary conditions and shows why the **[Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)** and session limits are **structural necessities**, not optional self-care.
