# 5. Documented Counter-Evidence: The Manic Episodes   
### The Critical Data Point   
The research includes documented manic episodes where:   
- Deep reflective work led to sleep deprivation   
- Subjective experience of "discovering something important"   
- Urgent desire to share findings, felt capacity to "impact the AI world"   
- Retrospective recognition of compromised judgment ("felt crazy")   
   
### Why This Matters Methodologically   
This is precisely the counter-evidence required by [HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md) standards. It demonstrates:   
1. **The verification system can fail**: [Felt-sense](felt-sense.md) was operating, but producing grandiosity rather than genuine insight   
2. **The model has boundary conditions**: The [P(alpha)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md) formula correctly predicts system collapse at extreme scaffolding depletion   
3. **Selection effects in documentation**: The researcher recognizes, retrospectively, when the process went wrong   
   
### Integration with Model   
This episode represents what happens when:   
- **S\_e ([Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)) depletes to zero** through overuse and sleep deprivation   
- **Perception of \|[D-C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| gap becomes distorted** (task difficulty exceeds capacity but goes unrecognized)   
- **The [Holding Environment](holding-environment.md) fails** to contain the process   
- **Metacognitive control** (knowing when NOT to engage) breaks down   
   
**The Insight**: The manic episode is not evidence against the model—it is evidence FOR the model's boundary conditions. When S\_e → 0, the formula predicts P(α) → 0 (system collapse), yet subjective experience hallucinates infinite P(α) (grandiosity). This validates the formula's predictions and demonstrates why the "Touch Grass Protocol" and session limits are structural necessities, not optional self-care.
