# Metacognition   
The concept of metacognition was introduced by the developmental psychologist [John H. Flavell](john-flavell.md) in the 1970s. He originally used the term metamemory in 1971, concerning an individual's ability to manage and monitor the input, storage, search, and retrieval of memory contents.   
### [Flavell](john-flavell.md)'s Definition of Metacognition   
Metacognition is commonly defined colloquially as "thinking about thinking" or cognitions about cognitions.   
Flavell’s formal definition emphasizes its active, dual nature:   
"Metacognition refers, among other things, to the active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these cognitive processes in relation to the cognitive objects or data on which they bear, usually in service of some concrete goal or objective".   
Flavell conceptualized metacognition as a double-sided ability that involves self-awareness and self-correction:   
1. The ability to monitor one's own thoughts, memories, and learning.   
2. The ability to regulate (or control) those processes in response to the monitoring, typically in service of a goal.   
   
### Components of Metacognition (Knowledge + Regulation)   
Flavell's seminal models distinguish between the static knowledge a person holds and the active control processes they use.   
Primary Components   
Flavell's model generally separates metacognition into two core functions:   
1. **Metacognitive Knowledge (Knowledge of Cognition):** This consists primarily of the stored world knowledge or beliefs about factors or variables that interact to affect the course and outcome of cognitive enterprises. This knowledge is a prerequisite for the independent use of learning strategies. It can be consciously activated (via a memory search) or automatically activated (by retrieval cues).   
    ◦ Flavell divided metacognitive knowledge into three categories of factors: person, task, and strategy.   
2. **Metacognitive Regulation (Control of Cognition):** This refers to the active control processes and skills involved in executing and modifying cognitive activities in relation to achieving a goal. This is sometimes referred to as metacognitive skills.
