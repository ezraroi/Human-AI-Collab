# 1. Purpose and Scope   
What this document is for:   
- Designing sessions to *sustain* viable field conditions over time   
- Diagnosing transformation failures   
- Choosing intervention levers   
- Teaching the schema to others   
- Annotating research sessions for cross-notebook analysis   
   
What it outputs:   
- A diagnosis and a lever choice, not a score   
   
What it is NOT:   
- A model of the entire system (that's the four-level architecture)   
- A measurement tool (no units, no calculation, no prediction)   
- A substitute for the recursive process (that's Level 3)   
- Uses viability semantics (viable / marginal / non-viable), not binary pass/fail.   
   
Relationship to canonical object: This document assumes familiarity with the [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) Research Component. Definitions, notation, architectural position, and failure mode taxonomy live there. This document covers application.
