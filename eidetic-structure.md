# Eidetic Structure   
**Definition:** The invariant form of transformation that remains constant regardless of which  model (Claude, Gemini, etc.) is used.
**Identified Structure:** The "[Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md)" architecture *is* the eidetic structure of digital self-transformation.
**Method:** Identified through "Cross-AI stress-testing" (Imaginative Variation).   
   
**Notes:** The invariant structure of transformation identified via imaginative variation.   
   
NOTE::::   
**Epistemic Status:** **Theoretical Framework???**   
**Why:** “Eidetic structure” is Husserlian, but here you define *the Third Intelligence architecture* as the invariant structure discovered via imaginative variation / cross-AI stress-testing. That claim is a **model-level theoretical assertion**, not a settled empirical fact.
