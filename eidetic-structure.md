# Eidetic Structure   
The invariant form of digital self-transformation that remains constant regardless of which AI model (Claude, Gemini, etc.) is used.   
**Identified structure:**   
The **[Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) architecture** is proposed as the eidetic structure of digital self-transformation.   
**Method of identification:**   
Identified through **Cross-AI stress-testing** as a form of **Imaginative Variation**.   
**Notes:**   
The invariant structure of transformation identified via imaginative variation.   
**Epistemic status:**   
**Theoretical framework** (a model-level claim), not a settled empirical fact.   
Rationale: “Eidetic structure” is Husserlian; here it names the invariant architecture inferred via imaginative variation / cross-AI stress-testing.
