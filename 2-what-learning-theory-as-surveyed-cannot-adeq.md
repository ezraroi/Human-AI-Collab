# 2. What Learning Theory (As Surveyed) Cannot Adequately Capture   
The following elements of this system do not have clear theoretical homes in the constructivist and cognitive learning traditions reviewed. This does not imply they are inherently novel—only that they are absent, underdeveloped, or not treated as structurally central within this specific literature base.   
### 2.1 Embodied Verification as Epistemic Method   
What this model requires:   
- A somatic component of verification (e.g., [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) as a truth-discriminator for internally persuasive discourse)   
- Bodily cues differentiating genuine insight from surface-level fluency   
- A pre-verbal evaluation stage that can precede (and constrain) linguistic articulation   
- Embodied engagement as part of meaning formation ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) recruitment, not post-hoc "checking")   
   
What learning theory (as surveyed) offers:   
- Predominantly symbolic and linguistic models of cognition   
- Limited integration of embodied cognition into mainstream learning frameworks   
- Few formal accounts of pre-linguistic or somatic knowing as epistemically authoritative   
- Metacognition framed primarily as conscious monitoring/regulation rather than embodied evaluation   
   
Gap status: Significant within the traditions reviewed. Related work in phenomenology and neurophenomenology addresses this more directly, but integration into mainstream cognitive learning theory appears limited. Further review is required to determine the degree to which embodied knowing has been incorporated into educational frameworks.   
### 2.2 Identity-Level Transformation vs. Skill Acquisition   
What this model documents:   
- Shifts in self-organization and authenticity   
- Reorientation of identity commitments   
- Development of personal idiom and agency   
- Transformation beyond skill or conceptual mastery   
   
What cognitive learning theory typically explains:   
- Skill acquisition and performance change   
- Conceptual understanding   
- Metacognitive development   
- Interest formation and motivation   
   
Gap: Cognitive learning theory models what learners can do. This work addresses changes in who learners become (identity-level reorganization). Transformative learning theory (Mezirow) and adult development frameworks (e.g., Kegan; Taylor) speak more directly to identity-level shifts and may provide a closer theoretical home.   
Gap status: Large within mainstream cognitive learning theory; potentially smaller within adult development literature. Requires deeper review.   
### 2.3 Temporal Architecture vs. Instructional Scheduling   
What this model requires:   
- Depletion and recovery cycles that shape whether learning/transformation is possible   
- Consolidation across days and weeks   
- Accumulated change in psychological capacity (C-growth) over time   
- Distinction between within-session processing and between-session integration   
- Transformation unfolding through recursive temporal structure (structural temporality, not mere duration)   
   
What learning theory (as surveyed) offers:   
- Spacing effects   
- Forgetting curves   
- Practice and scheduling considerations   
   
Gap: Learning science often treats time primarily as an instructional variable (how to schedule practice). This model treats time as a constitutive structural dimension of development: emotional and cognitive resources fluctuate, consolidation occurs across scales, and capacity growth is intrinsically diachronic.   
Gap status: Significant within the surveyed base. Additional review is needed in developmental psychology, systems consolidation neuroscience, and rhythm literature (e.g., circadian/ultradian dynamics) to determine closer matches.   
### 2.4 The Journal as Constitutive Chronotope (Distributed Substrate)   
What this model proposes:   
- The [Journal](journal.md) as a constitutive component of the system’s diachronic continuity (a **[chronotope](chronotope.md)**), not merely a reflective tool   
- [Materialization](materialization.md) as necessary for cross-session continuity and pattern recognition   
- A durable external substrate that enables re-entry, comparison, and integration across time   
- A stability function: the Journal constrains and stabilizes metabolized meaning without performing metabolization (the Human remains the metabolic agent)   
- A stable substrate enabling long-horizon integration (not a transcript, not a diary, not a memory aid)   
   
What learning theory (as surveyed) offers:   
- Journals as reflective practice   
- Writing as support for metacognition   
- Articulation as a learning tool   
   
Gap: In the surveyed traditions, journaling is typically treated as helpful but optional. Here, the Journal is framed as structurally necessary continuity infrastructure (a constitutive component of the system’s developmental loop). Related ideas likely exist in extended mind, distributed cognition, and artifact-mediated learning theories and require targeted review.   
Gap status: Moderate.   
### 2.5 AI as Functional Alterity   
What this model proposes:   
- AI as a source of productive difference ([Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md))   
- AI shaping how the pre-existing challenge is encountered turn-by-turn within the [ZPD](zpd.md) (without changing the structural \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| gap)   
- AI contributing to the maintenance of epistemic tension necessary for development (when Sₑ × Sₜ is adequate)   
- AI participating in meaning-making interaction as a functional partner in the dialogical field (without implying AI subjectivity)   
   
What AI-in-education research typically offers:   
- AI as feedback provider   
- AI as personalized tutor   
- AI as instructor or scaffolding delivery mechanism   
   
Gap: Many ITS and tutoring frameworks model AI primarily as a delivery mechanism for pedagogical strategies. This work highlights a role for AI as a dynamic contributor to meaning-making through structured difference and tension—an interactional function not well-captured by standard instructional framings.   
Gap status: Moderate to large. Dialogical learning frameworks and conversational-agent research may be relevant but appear under-integrated in the learning-theory contexts reviewed.
