# 11. Evolution History   
### Original Formula   
Version 1.0:   
P(α) = S / \|D-C\|   
What it captured:   
- Relationship between support and challenge   
- Inverse relationship to gap   
- Need for appropriate difficulty   
   
What it missed:   
- Different types of scaffolding   
- Why safety is non-negotiable   
- Multiplicative dependency   
   
### Refined Formula   
Version 2.0 (Current):   
P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / \|D-C\|   
Key refinement:   
- Split S into S\_e and S\_t   
- Changed from addition to multiplication   
- Revealed that both scaffolds are required   
   
Why this matters:   
- Captures that S\_e = 0 nullifies everything   
- Shows safety is prerequisite, not optional   
- Explains why "perfect technique" fails without trust   
   
### Rationale for Multiplication   
The S\_e discovery came from analyzing:   
- Why does PSB fail despite "infinite" support?   
- Where is the "holding environment" in the model?   
- Why can't technical excellence compensate for fear?   
   
Answer: Different types of scaffolding that are multiplicative, not additive.   
This was the breakthrough that completed the model and linked all theoretical frameworks (Winnicott, Bion, Vygotsky) into coherent system.
