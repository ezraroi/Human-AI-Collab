# 4Ps Protocol   
A four-step [metacognitive](metacognition.md) verification loop preventing passive consumption of AI outputs. Forces real-time metabolic processing by requiring explicit pause, questioning, articulation, and embodied verification before accepting insights.   
**Purpose:**   
**Primary:** Prevents [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (Protein Shake Brain) by breaking automatic acceptance pattern
   
**The Four Steps:**   
**1. Pause (Inhibition)**   
- **Action:** Stop before accepting AI output   
- **Function:** Interrupts System 1 automatic agreement   
- **Prevents:** Confirmation bias, passive consumption   
- **Observable:** Deliberate break in interaction flow   
   
**2. Probe (Monitoring)**   
- **Action:** Question the insight actively   
- **Function:** Tests against other knowledge/experience   
- **Asks:** "Is this actually true? Does this match my experience?"   
- **Observable:** Explicit questioning, seeking counterexamples   
   
**3. Process (Control/Self-Explanation)**   
- **Action:** Articulate reasoning in own words   
- **Function:** Forces explicit understanding, not borrowed fluency   
- **Requires:** Can explain without reproducing AI language   
- **Observable:** Rewriting, independent explanation   
   
**4. Possess (Evaluation/Verification)**   
- **Action:** Check against felt sense and real-life grounding   
- **Function:** Embodied verification + concrete examples   
- **Tests:** "Spacious" vs. "tight" felt sense, real-world applicability   
- **Observable:** Somatic checking, concrete grounding   
   
**Observable Markers:**   
**4Ps Active (Healthy Processing):**   
- Visible pauses between AI output and acceptance   
- Active questioning of AI assertions   
- Can explain concept independently   
- References felt sense explicitly   
- Provides concrete real-life examples   
- Writing feels grounded, personal   
   
**4Ps Bypassed (PSB Risk):**   
- Immediate acceptance without pause   
- No questioning or challenge   
- Reproduces AI phrasing verbatim   
- No felt sense checking   
- Abstract claims without concrete grounding   
- High velocity, minimal processing time   
   
**Relations (Wiring):**   
- **Component Of:** Reflective Prompting   
- **Prevents:** PSB, passive consumption   
- **Uses:** Felt Sense (in Possess step for embodied verification)   
- **Enables:** Metabolic processing, genuine ownership   
- **Alternative To:** Automatic acceptance, passive reception   
   
   
**Notes:**   
4Ps is the **micro-method** preventing PSB at moment-to-moment level. While Reflective Prompting provides macro-structure (phases), 4Ps provides micro-discipline (verification steps). Simple 4-step sequence, but consistency determines whether transformation or consumption occurs.   
Critical: Not a one-time checklist—must be applied **repeatedly throughout session** whenever accepting AI output. The protocol is simple; the discipline is hard.
