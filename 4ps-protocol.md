# 4Ps Protocol   
A four-step **acceptance gate** that operationalizes metacognitive monitoring + regulation ([Flavell](john-flavell.md)) to prevent passive consumption of AI outputs. 4Ps requires explicit interruption, challenge, self-explanation, and embodied verification before adopting an output as ‘owned’; when durable ownership is required, **Possess completes through writing-as-execution (continuous verification producing a Journal entry) plus time-delayed re-entry**.   
### Minimal Constrained-Integration Link   
4Ps is a **local intervention** used when drift threatens transformation conditions: it pulls the user back from “cold fluency” into **owned processing** by (1) interrupting autopilot, (2) restoring epistemic responsibility, (3) re-authoring in one’s idiom, and (4) requiring **embodied + time-delayed verification** (i.e., the As-If Body Loop is most explicitly engaged in **Possess**, and often begins in **Process**). It also supports **SN integrative mode** by reintroducing “check + integration” instead of “consume + proceed.”   
## Purpose   
- **Primary:** Prevents **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** by breaking automatic acceptance and keeping embodied verification online at uptake moments.   
- **Psychodynamic:** Enacts **topographic return**—a structured return to the affective origin of thought so it can be re-symbolized (restoring linking/metabolization rather than consuming fluency).   
   
## System Role   
- **Triage rule:** Not a universal workflow. Invoke 4Ps when **authorship is at stake** (identity-stakes or meaningful professional/creative work).   
- **Trigger:** **Ownership Alarms** (PSB markers) → shift from transaction mode to **Work Group** stance.   
- **In-session:** Applied whenever the user is about to accept an AI output as true/meaningful/mine.   
- **Possess extension:** For [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) work, “Possess” may complete via **[Journal](journal.md) inscription + time-delayed re-entry**.   
   
### Positioning in the Two-Axis Framework   
- **Primary target:** **Axis B** drift (PSB / symbolic-only bypass).   
- **Secondary effect:** **Axis A** support (reduces authority drift by enforcing epistemic authorship during Probe/Process).   
   
### Distinction from RPVL   
- **RPVL:** continuous verification posture across dialogue (epistemic mechanism).   
- **4Ps:** local **action sequence** at the moment of uptake (acceptance gate).

```
## The Four Steps   
### 1) Pause (Inhibition / Cognitive Forcing Function)   
- **Action:** Stop before accepting the output.   
- **Function:** Interrupt autopilot endorsement; reintroduce agency and friction.   
- **Anchor:** Cognitive Forcing Function (CFF).   
- **Done when:** You can feel you are choosing, not sliding.   
   
### 2) Probe (Monitoring / Epistemic Responsibility)   
- **Action:** Actively test the claim.   
- **Function:** Stress-tests truth/fit; punctures “AI-as-authority” drift; surfaces tension.   
- **Prompts:**   
    - “What would falsify this?”   
    - “Where doesn’t it fit?”   
    - “What’s the strongest counter-argument?”   
    - “What assumption is doing the work?”   
- **Done when:** You have at least one credible counterexample/edge case and a clearer boundary of validity.   
   
### 3) Process (Control / Self-Explanation / Idiom Translation)   
- **Action:** Re-articulate in your own words (no karaoke voice).   
- **Function:** Forces model repair and idiom alignment; converts borrowed fluency into authored meaning.   
- **Rule:** If you can’t explain it without mimicking phrasing, you haven’t processed it.   
- **Done when:** You can explain it cleanly, in your idiom, and re-derive the logic.   
   
### 4) Possess (Evaluation / Embodied + Time-Delayed Authorship)   
- **Action:** Verify via felt sense + grounding; then test ownership through time-delayed re-entry and/or inscription.   
- **Function:** Transfers authorship from “sounds right” → “is mine.”   
- **Checks:**   
    - Spacious vs tight (“does this *land*?”)   
    - One concrete instantiation (“where is this true in my life/work?”) **and, where available, evidential grounding (test the structural claim against concrete instances/artifacts)**   
    - Durability (“can I explain this tomorrow without notes?”)   
- **Identity-stakes:** Complete via [Journal](journal.md) inscription (**[chronotope](chronotope.md): [diachronic alterity](diachronic-alterity.md) / addressable past-self I-position**; transcript is not enough).   
- **Escalation:** Persistent tightness / grounding failure / rising depletion → **[Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)** (do not force adoption).   
- **Done when:** It survives re-entry and feels both reconstructable and internally authored.   
   
## Alarm → Step Routing (Operational Map)   
|                                             Ownership Alarm | Primary Step |                         Generative Action |
|:------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------|:------------------------------------------|
|            **Karaoke Voice** (can’t rephrase authentically) |  **PROCESS** |  Translate to your idiom; re-derive logic |
|                   **Brittle Confidence** (fear of scrutiny) |    **PROBE** |    Stress-test; surface counter-arguments |
|         **Flat Soda / Cognitive Lag** (foreign on re-entry) |  **POSSESS** | Time-delayed test; re-enter without notes |
|     **Defaulting to Compliance** (“good enough” acceptance) |    **PAUSE** |      Reintroduce friction; restore agency |

## Observable Markers   
### 4Ps Active (Healthy Uptake)   
- Visible pause before acceptance   
- Explicit counterexamples / boundaries of validity   
- Independent explanation in own idiom   
- Felt-sense referenced (spacious/tight; lands/doesn’t)   
- One concrete instantiation   
- Successful time-delayed re-entry (reconstructable without source)   
   
### 4Ps Bypassed (PSB Risk)   
- Immediate adoption, no pause   
- No probing; no tension surfaced   
- AI phrasing reproduced verbatim   
- No embodied check   
- Abstract “insight” without grounding   
- Re-entry failure / compulsive return to the source
