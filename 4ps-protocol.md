# 4Ps Protocol   
A four-step verification protocol that operationalizes metacognitive monitoring and consequent regulation ([Flavell](john-flavell.md)) to prevent passive consumption of AI outputs. It requires explicit interruption, challenge, self-explanation, and embodied verification **before** accepting an insight as "owned."   
### Purpose   
**Primary:** Prevents [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (Protein Shake Brain) by breaking automatic acceptance patterns and keeping [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (embodied verification) online.   
### Scope / Role in Architecture   
- **In-session method:** 4Ps is applied during [Human](human.md)↔[AI](ai.md) dialogue whenever the user is about to adopt an AI output as true/meaningful/"mine."   
- **Possess may extend:** When work carries [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md), the Possess step may completes through [Journal](journal.md) inscription (which may occur after session).   
- **Distinction from [RPVL](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md):** RPVL is the continuous verification loop running across all dialogue phases; 4Ps is the local "acceptance gate" at the moment of uptake. RPVL describes the epistemic mechanism; 4Ps provides the practitioner action sequence.   
   
### The Four Steps   
**1) Pause (Inhibition)**   
- **Action:** Stop before accepting AI output   
- **Function:** Interrupts System 1 automatic agreement   
- **Prevents:** Confirmation bias, passive consumption   
- **Observable:** Deliberate break in interaction flow   
   
**2) Probe (Monitoring)**   
- **Action:** Question the insight actively   
- **Function:** Tests against other knowledge, counterexamples, lived experience   
- **Asks:** "Is this actually true? What would falsify it? Where doesn't it fit?"   
- **Observable:** Explicit questioning, seeking counterexamples   
   
**3) Process (Control / Self-Explanation)**   
- **Action:** Re-articulate the reasoning in your own words   
- **Function:** Forces understanding (model repair), not borrowed fluency   
- **Requires:** Can explain without reproducing AI language   
- **Observable:** Rewriting, independent explanation in personal idiom   
   
**4) Possess (Evaluation / Verification)**   
- **Action:** Verify via felt sense and concrete grounding; then "own" it through real-world test or inscription   
- **Function:** Embodied verification + ecological validity + ownership transfer   
- **Tests:** Spacious vs. tight; "does this land?" + "where is this true in my life/work?"   
- **Observable:** Somatic checking + at least one concrete example or action   
- **When identity-stakes:** Complete ownership through Journal inscription (insight becomes lived knowledge, not information)   
- **Escalation rule:** If tightness persists, grounding fails, or arousal/depletion is rising → **stop / Touch Grass Protocol** (do not force adoption)   
   
### Observable Markers   
**4Ps Active (Healthy Processing):**   
- Visible pauses between AI output and acceptance   
- Active questioning of AI assertions   
- Can explain concept independently in own idiom   
- References felt sense explicitly   
- Provides concrete real-life examples   
- Writing feels grounded, personal   
   
**4Ps Bypassed (PSB Risk):**   
- Immediate acceptance without pause   
- No questioning or challenge   
- Reproduces AI phrasing verbatim   
- No felt sense checking   
- Abstract claims without concrete grounding   
- High velocity, minimal processing time   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- **Component Of:** [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md)   
- **Runs Inside / Local Gate Of:** [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) (RPVL)   
- **Operationalizes:** [Metacognition](metacognition.md) (Flavell's monitoring + regulation cycle)   
- **Prevents:** PSB, passive consumption   
- **Uses:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (Possess step)   
- **Uses:** [Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md) (Process step)   
- **Routes To (on failure):** [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)   
- **Enables:** Metabolic processing, genuine ownership, authorship   
- **Alternative To:** Automatic acceptance, passive reception   
   
### Notes   
4Ps is the **micro-method** preventing PSB at moment-to-moment level. While Reflective Prompting provides macro-structure (phases) and RPVL provides the continuous epistemic safety loop, 4Ps provides micro-discipline (verification steps) at each acceptance decision.   
Simple 4-step sequence, but consistency determines whether transformation or consumption occurs.   
**Critical:** Not a one-time checklist—must be applied repeatedly throughout session whenever accepting AI output. The protocol is simple; the discipline is hard.   
**Multi-functionality:** 4Ps functions simultaneously as:   
- Cognitive mechanism (operationalizing Flavell's metacognition)   
- Research method (within-session verification for N=1 methodology)   
- Pedagogical protocol (teachable discipline for practitioners)
