# 4Ps Protocol   
**Definition:** A metacognitive loop: **Pause** (Inhibition), **Probe** (Monitoring), **Process** (Control/Self-Explanation), **Possess** (Evaluation/Verification) .   
## Methodological Equivalent   
This protocol serves as the **Phenomenological Validity Criteria** for the research. It translates subjective experience into rigorous data points:   
1. **Pause (Inhibition):** Acts as **Methodological Control**. It prevents "System 1" automatic agreement (Confirmation Bias).   
2. **Probe (Monitoring):** Acts as **Concurrent Validity Assessment**. checking the insight against other data sources.   
3. **Process (Control):** Acts as **Process Tracing**. Documenting the steps of logic.   
4. **Possess (Evaluation):** Acts as **Ecological Validity**. Checking if the insight holds up in "real life" (Concrete Grounding).
