# 6. Documented Counter-Evidence: The Manic Episodes   
### The Critical Data Point   
The research includes documented manic episodes where:   
- Deep reflective work led to sleep deprivation   
- Subjective experience of "discovering something important"   
- Urgent desire to share findings, felt capacity to "impact the AI world"   
- Retrospective recognition of compromised judgment ("felt crazy")   
   
### Why This Matters Methodologically   
This is precisely the counter-evidence required by HSCED standards. It demonstrates:   
1. The verification system can fail: Felt-sense was operating, but producing grandiosity rather than genuine insight   
2. The model has boundary conditions: The P(α) formula may produce destabilization when scaffolding ratios become extreme   
3. Selection effects in documentation: The researcher recognizes, retrospectively, when the process went wrong   
   
### Integration with Model   
This episode likely represents what happens when:   
- S\_e (emotional scaffolding) becomes depleted through overuse   
- \|D-C\| gap increases (task difficulty exceeds capacity) but goes unrecognized   
- The "holding environment" fails to contain the process   
- Metacognitive control (knowing when NOT to engage) breaks down   
   
The Insight: The manic episode is not evidence against the model - it is evidence FOR the model's boundary conditions. It demonstrates why the "Touch Grass Protocol" and session limits are structural necessities, not optional self-care.
