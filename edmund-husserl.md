# Edmund Husserl   
Provides the Structure of Consciousness.   
Noesis/Noema/Hyle: The triadic structure of experience that parallels the Bionian metabolic process.   
Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) was the founder of Phenomenology. He established the method of "bracketing" (epoché) to study the invariant structures of consciousness.   
Relevance to Model:   
Notebook 7 identifies a direct structural homology between Husserl's triad and the Alpha-Function:   
- **Hyle** (Raw sensory data) →[Beta**-Elements**](beta-elements.md)   
- **Noesis** (The act of experiencing) →[Alph**a-Function**](alpha-function.md)   
- **Noema** (The object as meant) →[Alph**a-Elements**](alpha-elements.md)
