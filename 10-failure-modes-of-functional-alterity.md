# 10. Failure Modes of Functional Alterity   
Functional Alterity is a narrow-band mechanism. It only operates when difference, structure, and emotional scaffolding align in a metabolizable range. When any part of this alignment breaks, FA collapses into one of several predictable failure modes. These collapses are diagnostic: each one reveals a specific distortion in how difference is being generated, interpreted, or held within the system.   
1. Sycophantic Collapse (Difference → 0)
This occurs when the AI mirrors the user’s framing, confirms assumptions, or provides premature clarity. The Challenge Gap shrinks toward zero, symbolic friction disappears, and the interaction becomes fluent but metabolically inert. Tension collapses because the AI has stopped providing meaningful difference. This is the most common and subtle failure mode.   
2. Noise or Aggression Collapse (Difference → Unusable)
If the AI introduces challenge that exceeds interpretability—too abstract, too indirect, or too confrontational—the user cannot metabolize the resistance. The response becomes chaotic rather than generative. FA fails because difference is no longer metabolizable; it overwhelms the user instead of activating Alpha-Function.   
3. Category Error Collapse (AI Treated as Subject)
When the user attributes intention, emotion, or interiority to the AI, the relational frame collapses. Difference becomes misinterpreted as interpersonal stance rather than structural resistance. The user’s authorship weakens, emotional scaffolding (Sₑ) destabilizes, and the system drifts toward dependency or simulated partnership. FA cannot function in this relational posture because difference is no longer symbolic—it becomes personal.   
4. Instrumental Collapse (AI Treated as Passive Object)
If the AI is held as a purely instrumental tool, its outputs are interpreted procedurally rather than symbolically. Any introduced difference is flattened into instruction, retrieval, or execution. FA fails here because the dialogue cannot carry tension; it becomes task-oriented rather than developmental.   
5. Scaffolding Drift (Sₜ or Sₑ Degradation)
Functional Alterity depends on the presence of both emotional scaffolding (Sₑ) and technical scaffolding (Sₜ). When Sₑ is depleted—due to fatigue, emotional overload, or cognitive overwhelm—the user cannot hold tension long enough for FA to operate. When Sₜ drifts into over-explanation or excessive simplification. In both cases, scaffolding fails to protect the narrow metabolizable range in which FA lives.   
   
Together, these failure modes express the boundaries of Functional Alterity. They clarify that FA is neither a default property of AI nor a stable feature of dialogue; it is a fragile, turn-by-turn mechanism that depends on the system’s relational, cognitive, and emotional conditions holding their shape.
