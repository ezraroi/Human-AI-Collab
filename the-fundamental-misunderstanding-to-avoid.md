# The Fundamental Misunderstanding to Avoid   
WRONG MODEL:   
AI Conversation → Insights → Write Journal Entry → Verify   
CORRECT MODEL:   
Reflective Prompting (with continuous verification) →   
Materialization Through Writing (dual process with AI) →   
Journal Entry (verified substrate) →   
Claude Project (pattern recognition infrastructure)   
Verification is not something you do TO journal entries. Verification IS the method through which journal entries are created.
