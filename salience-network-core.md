# Salience Network Core   
A large-scale network anchored in the **[Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md)** and **dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC/ACC)**, associated with detecting **salience** (internal/external), allocating attention, and coordinating the interaction between **internally oriented self-processing** (DMN) and **executive constraint** (FPN/CEN).   
In the Third Intelligence architecture, the SN is not merely a “switch.” It is the leading candidate **mode-setter / gatekeeper**: it determines whether the brain enters an **integrative regime** (DMN–control coordination under load) or remains in / collapses into **antagonistic regimes** (one system suppresses the other, or unstable switching). This mode-setting function is upstream of whether **[Field Viability](field-viability-schema.md)** exists for transformation work in a given session.   
### Core Functions   
**1) Salience Detection**   
- Detects biologically or cognitively significant signals from both **external** stimuli and the **internal milieu**.   
- **AIC emphasis:** interoceptive salience (felt sense, body state signals, affective intensity).   
- **dACC emphasis:** conflict/error monitoring and cognitive salience (decision points, control demand).   
   
**2) Mode-Setting (not just switching)**   
- **Classical view:** SN mediates rapid switching between DMN and FPN dominance.   
- **Refined view:** SN determines the **mode** of DMN–FPN interaction:   
    - **Antagonistic mode:** suppression/segregation dominates (typical in pure external tasks or threat-biased states).   
    - **Integrative mode:** SN permits or stabilizes DMN content being held under executive constraint (constrained internal generation).   
- This mode-setting likely depends on current **Sₑ availability**, threat level, task demands, and prior state (runtime, not trait).   
   
**3) Integration Hub (embodied-to-symbolic routing)**   
- When integrative mode is set, SN supports information flow such that **interoceptive / affective signals** can enter executive constraint rather than being gated out or flooding the system.   
- This is the plausible biological bridge for **Channel 1 verification** to constrain Channel 2 symbolization.   
   
### System Role in Third Intelligence   
SN Core is the candidate gating mechanism for the **[Constrained Integration Hypothesis](the-constrained-integration-hypothesis.md)**, linking:   
- **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (interoception):** AIC is the hub; SN gates whether felt-sense signals reach executive workspace.   
- **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) feasibility:** SN mode-setting helps determine whether difficult material can be held long enough for metabolization (integration mode) versus bypass/collapse.   
- **Triple Network dynamics:** SN is the coordinator whose mode-setting is upstream of DMN ↔ FPN coordination patterns.   
- **[Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) (runtime):** SN function is a leading upstream variable for whether a session is viable for transformation work *now*.   
- **Sₑ ([Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)):** SN flexibility is plausibly constrained by ANS/HPA state; under depletion, SN may default to threat/rigidity or dysregulated switching.   
   
**Architectural boundary:** SN mode-setting is a constraint layer. It does not define transformation. Transformation still requires **verification posture + embodied verification + materialization over time**.   
### Operational Markers (candidate proxies; hypothesized)   
**Neural / lab measures (high fidelity):**   
- Dynamic connectivity / state transition indices (fMRI)   
- Phase-based coordination metrics (EEG/MEG)   
- AIC engagement under interoceptive attention paradigms; dACC engagement under conflict/salience paradigms   
   
**Phenomenological markers (within-session):**   
- “Salience moments”: felt-sense intensification or felt-shift events preceding insight/contact (hypothesis)   
- Subjective “this matters” signal that precedes a pivot into deeper work (or precedes overwhelm)   
   
**Physiological proxies (supporting, not definitive):**   
- **HRV (candidate):** higher vagal flexibility → more flexible SN function / integrative mode entry; lower HRV → rigid or threat-biased SN mode   
- Skin conductance (phasic responses) and pupil dilation (phasic vs sustained patterns) as salience/arousal co-markers   
   
### Testable Predictions (state contrasts)   
**Transformation-viable (integrative mode):**   
- SN detects salience without overwhelm; sets/maintains integrative mode.   
- DMN self-reference remains online under FPN constraint.   
- Phenomenology: **protected self-holding while engaging challenge**; felt-sense is available as verifier.   
- Candidate physiology: relatively higher HRV; phasic (not sustained) arousal markers.   
   
**Bypass / [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)-adjacent (non-metabolic fluency):**   
- Executive/language output remains high, but SN does not route interoceptive salience into constraint.   
- Phenomenology: fluent coherence without felt verification (“self-offline”); Channel 1 thin.   
- Network dynamics alone may look “coherent”; discriminator is **embodied verification**, not activation patterns.   
   
**Rumination-like collapse:**   
- SN fails to shift out of internally captured salience loops; DMN dominates; constraint decouples.   
- Phenomenology: “stuck in loop,” circular self-reference without integration.   
   
**Overload / threat collapse:**   
- Salience overwhelms regulation capacity; SN becomes hyperreactive or unstable; antagonism/dysregulation increases.   
- Phenomenology: “too much,” fragmentation, loss of self-holding; DMN suppression or chaotic switching.   
   
**Key discriminator:** transformation-viable states show **flexible** SN mode-setting; collapse states show **rigid** or **dysregulated** SN mode dynamics.   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- **Component of:** [Triple Network Model](triple-network-model.md) (but singled out for measurement focus)   
- **Enables / upstream of:** [Constrained Integration Hypothesis](the-constrained-integration-hypothesis.md) (mode-setting determines whether coordination is possible)   
- **Determines (runtime):** [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)   
- **Anchored by:** [Anterior Insular Cortex ](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md)(interoception hub) + dACC/ACC (conflict/control demand)   
- **Bridges:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) ↔ Executive Constraint ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verification routing)   
- **Constrains:** [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) feasibility under load (necessary condition candidate)   
- **Constrained by:** [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ) / [ANS](autonomic-nervous-system-regulation-ans-vagal-.md) regulation (candidate: HRV) and [HPA-axis ](hpa-axis.md)stress state   
- **Connected to:** [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md); embodied-to-symbolic integration mechanisms   
   
### Notes   
This object exists to prevent overloading the Triple Network Model and to make the **mode-setting mechanism explicit and measurable**. The key refinement from Constrained Integration research is that the SN is not only a switch but a **mode-setter** that is plausibly upstream of session viability.
