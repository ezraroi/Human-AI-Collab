# 3. How Entries Are Created   
[Journal](journal.md) entries are not written. They are worked through — and the writing is the working.   
### The Starting Point   
You begin with something unresolved:   
- A feeling you don't fully understand   
- An observation that won't let go   
- A tension between what you think and what you feel   
- Something the AI said that landed strangely   
   
You don't need clarity to start. You need something that's alive — unfinished, pulling at you.   
### The Semantic Commitment Loop   
This is the micro-engine of entry creation:   
1. Attempt phrasing — Write something in your own words. Not AI's words. Your idiom, your way of saying it.   
2. Read it back — Does this actually say what you mean?   
3. [Felt-sense](felt-sense.md) check — Does it land as true? Spacious or tight? Alive or flat?   
4. Revise — If it's off, try again. Different words. More precise. Closer to what you actually mean.   
5. Repeat — Until something stabilizes. Until the words and the felt-sense converge.   
   
This loop may run dozens of times in a single entry. That's the work.   
### What Happens During This Process   
You're not transcribing thoughts. You're discovering what you actually think by forcing yourself to commit to words and then checking whether they're true.   
The AI can help:   
- Reflecting back what you said   
- Challenging vague formulations   
- Asking what you mean   
- Noticing contradictions   
   
But the AI cannot do the loop for you. The felt-sense check is yours. The revision is yours. The "yes, this is what I mean" is yours.   
### Dual-Channel Integration   
Throughout this process, two channels must stay coupled:   
[Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (Symbolic): The words, the articulation, the conceptual framing [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (Embodied): The felt-sense, the body's response, the "true/not-true" signal   
If you write without checking Channel 1 → you produce fluent text that isn't owned. If you feel without articulating through Channel 2 → you have experience but no stable form.   
The loop keeps both channels in conversation until they align.   
### What It Feels Like When It's Working   
- Frustration → reorganization → relief   
- "Almost... almost... yes, THAT"   
- A click, a settling, a spaciousness   
- The words feel like yours, not borrowed   
- You could say this without the AI in front of you   
   
### What It Feels Like When It's Not Working   
- Smooth, easy, no friction   
- "That sounds right" without a felt-shift   
- You're nodding but nothing moved   
- The words could have come from anywhere   
- Re-reading later produces blankness   
   
The friction is not a problem to solve. The friction is the work.
