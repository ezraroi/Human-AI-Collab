# Cognitive Dependency   
Cognitive Dependency is the **system-level collapse** that occurs when both axes of the Third Intelligence fail simultaneously.   
It emerges when the user **misclassifies the AI as a Subject** (Category Error) *and* bypasses embodied metabolic processing (PSB), resulting in the **atrophy of the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)**.   
### System Role   
- Represents the **combined pathology** of relational collapse + metabolic collapse.   
- Describes the state where the user outsources both **validation** (emotional) and **cognition** (processing) to the AI.   
- Marks the point at which \|D–C\| effectively collapses to zero and transformation becomes impossible.   
- Serves as the **diagnostic endpoint** for misuse of AI within the Third Intelligence.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Composed of:**   
    - Category Error   
    - Protein Shake Brain (PSB)   
- **Results In:** [False True Self](false-true-self.md) (loss of authorship)   
- **Inhibited By:** [Metabolic Discipline](metabolic-discipline.md)   
- **Mapped By:** Two-Axis Framework
