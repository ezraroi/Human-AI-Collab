# Cognitive Dependency   
Cognitive Dependency is the **system-level collapse** that occurs when both axes of the Third Intelligence fail simultaneously.   
It emerges when the user **misclassifies the AI as a Subject** ([Category Error](category-error.md)) *and* bypasses embodied metabolic processing ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)), resulting in the under-engagement** of the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)**.   
### System Role   
- Represents the **combined pathology** of relational collapse + metabolic collapse.   
- Describes the state where the user outsources both **validation** (emotional) and **cognition** (processing) to the AI.   
- Marks the point at which \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| effectively collapses to zero and transformation becomes impossible.   
- Serves as the **diagnostic endpoint** for misuse of AI within the Third Intelligence.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Composed of:**   
    - Category Error   
    - Protein Shake Brain ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md))   
- **Results In:** [Transmissive Self](transmissive-self.md)   
- **Mapped By:** [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md)   
- **Often Preceded By** → [Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md) collapse   
   
**Notes:** Axis A + Axis B failure at the same time.
