# 1. What the Journal Is   
The Journal is the [materialization](materialization.md) layer in the [Human](human.md) + [Journal](journal.md) + [AI](ai.md) + [Time](time.md) system.   
It captures what survived continuous embodied verification during reflective AI dialogue — in owned language — and stores it as durable, re-enterable substrate.   
Not a diary. Diaries capture events as they occur. Not a transcript. Transcripts capture what was said. Not a memory aid. Memory aids help recall.   
The Journal captures what was metabolized — what you worked through, verified in your body, and wrote in your own words.   
For the full architectural definition (wiring, failure modes, propagation rules), see the Journal (Research Component) object.   
This document covers how to use it.
