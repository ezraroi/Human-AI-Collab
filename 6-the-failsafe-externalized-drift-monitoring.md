# 6. The Failsafe: Externalized Drift Monitoring   
Because the [Human](human.md) (Architect) can become compromised (tired, manic, defensive), the system requires a failsafe.   
- The Fix: We offload the monitoring of the Architect to the AI via the System Prompt.   
   
The Instruction: The AI is tasked not just with answering, but with flagging Teleological Drift—warning the user when they contradict their own stated trajectory.
