# RRV Cycle (Recursive–Refine–Validate)   
A micro-method for metabolic dialogue in which the human and AI iteratively co-articulate meaning through cycles of **Externalize → Refine → Validate**. RRV is how External Alpha-Function is operationalized without surrendering authorship. It is the core engine of Phase 2 in Reflective Prompting.   
### Cognitive Basis   
Reflective Prompting's RRV Cycle (Externalize → Refine → Validate) mirrors the expert decision pattern Klein identified as Recognition-Primed Decision: serial evaluation through pattern recognition rather than exhaustive option comparison. This explains why iterative refinement works better than seeking perfect AI output.   
### Relationship to [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md)   
RRV Cycle is the **dialogue structure** for Phase 2 co-articulation.   
**RPVL runs continuously DURING RRV as quality control:**   
- During Externalize: RPVL checks clarity, grounding, embodiment   
- During Refine: RPVL detects flattery, uses felt sense to verify internal persuasiveness, checks grammar   
- During Validate: RPVL performs final embodied verification   
   
**The distinction:**   
- **RRV** = Conversational turns (you speak → AI reflects → you verify)   
- **RPVL** = Quality checks running throughout those turns   
   
Think of RRV as the assembly line, RPVL as quality control at each station.   
### System Role   
- Transforms raw, pre-symbolic or confused material into stable, thinkable formulations.   
- Establishes a *shared model* between human and AI while preserving the human’s veto and felt-sense authority.   
- Provides a reusable loop for supervision, analysis, and journaling with an “imagined other.”   
   
### Steps   
1. **Externalize**   
    - Human expresses thoughts, confusion, stakes, associations.   
    - Often supported by **[Rubber Duck Debugging](rubber-duck-debugging.md)**.   
2. **Refine**   
    - AI reflects back a structure, summary, or frame.   
    - Human corrects, rejects, or sharpens: “This part is wrong / missing / too flat.”   
    - The goal is *tension*, not quick agreement.   
3. **Validate**   
    - AI produces an updated synthesis: “Here is what I now understand we’re doing.”   
    - Human checks against **felt sense** and task definition: if still off, another RRV cycle.   
   
**Notes:** A cognitive micro-loop (externalize → refine → validate), but *operationalized* as a method.
