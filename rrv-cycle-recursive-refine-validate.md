# RRV Cycle (Recursive–Refine–Validate)   
**RRV Cycle (Recursive–Refine–Validate)** is a micro-method for metabolic dialogue in which the human and AI iteratively co-articulate meaning through cycles of **Externalize → Refine → Validate**. **RRV is the dialogue structure within which [Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW)](enacted-alpha-work-eaw.md) can be enacted without surrendering authorship.** It is the core engine of **Phase 2** in [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md).   
**Architectural precision:** RRV creates the *conditions* for EAW; it does **not** guarantee EAW occurs. The human must still perform **semantic commitment under felt-sense constraint** inside the RRV structure.   
### Cognitive Basis   
Reflective Prompting’s RRV Cycle (Externalize → Refine → Validate) mirrors the expert decision pattern Gary Klein identified as **Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD)**: serial evaluation through pattern recognition rather than exhaustive option comparison. This helps explain why iterative refinement outperforms attempts to obtain “perfect” AI output in a single pass.   
### Relationship to [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) (RPVL)   
RRV is the **turn-structure** for Phase 2 co-articulation.   
RPVL runs continuously **during** RRV as quality control:   
- During **Externalize**: RPVL checks grounding, stakes, and embodied contact   
- During **Refine**: RPVL detects flattery / over-smooth coherence, checks felt-sense fit, detects drift, checks clarity/grammar   
- During **Validate**: RPVL performs final embodied verification and authorship check   
   
**Distinction:**   
- **RRV =** assembly line (conversational stations)   
- **RPVL =** quality control at each station   
   
### System Role   
- Transforms raw, pre-symbolic or confused material into **stable, thinkable formulations**.   
- Establishes a shared working model between human and AI while preserving the human’s **veto** and **felt-sense authority**.   
- Provides a reusable loop for supervision, analysis, and journaling with an “imagined other.”   
- Creates the iterative structure within which **EAW’s Semantic Commitment Loop** can be enacted.   
   
### Steps   
**1) Externalize**   
- Human expresses thoughts, confusion, stakes, associations.   
- Often supported by [Rubber Duck Debugging](rubber-duck-debugging.md).   
- **EAW note:** initial articulation attempt ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) comes online), usually before stable ownership is achieved.   
   
**2) Refine**   
- AI reflects back a structure, summary, or candidate frame.   
- Human corrects, rejects, or sharpens: “This part is wrong / missing / too flat.”   
- The goal is **tension**, not quick agreement.   
- **EAW note:** this is where metabolic labor must occur. The human must re-articulate in their **own idiom**, performing felt-sense verification against the AI’s offering. If the human merely accepts the AI frame, EAW fails and [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk increases.   
   
**3) Validate**   
- AI produces an updated synthesis: “Here is what I now understand we’re doing.”   
- Human checks against felt sense and task definition; if still off, another RRV cycle begins.   
- **EAW note:** stabilization check—does the articulation now hold as **owned meaning**? If not, recycle.   
   
**Note:** RRV is a cognitive micro-loop operationalized as a method. **RRV is structure; EAW is the metabolic work that may or may not occur within that structure.**   
### Relations (updated)   
- **Embedded in →** Reflective Prompting (Phase 2)   
- **Uses →** [Rubber Duck Debugging](rubber-duck-debugging.md); [Metacognitive](metacognition.md) monitoring and regulation; Felt Sense; RPVL   
- **Creates conditions for →** [Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW)](enacted-alpha-work-eaw.md)   
- **Supports →** [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) recruitment *(capacity strengthened over time via repeated EAW enactments)*
