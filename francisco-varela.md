# Francisco Varela   
Provides the **Methodological Stance**.    
***Neurophenomenology:*** The scientific research program aimed at bridging the "hard problem" by treating first-person experience (phenomenology) and third-person data (neuroscience) as mutually constraining.    
***Enactivism:*** The view that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment.   
Francisco Varela (1946–2001) was a Chilean biologist, philosopher, and neuroscientist who, along with Humberto Maturana, introduced the concept of autopoiesis. He later founded **Neurophenomenology**, arguing that science cannot ignore lived experience but must rigorously integrate it with biological data.   
**Relevance to Model:**   
- His work provides the rigorous justification for why the **Subjective** (User/Journal) and **Objective** (AI/Structure) must circulate mutually rather than one replacing the other.
