# 2. Clarifying the Category Error Against the DTO Classification   
No contradiction exists between the [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) framework and the [Category Error](category-error.md) doctrine.
Cross-checking all sources confirms they operate at different levels but reinforce one another.   
### 2.1 Category Error Doctrine (Tier 1)   
The Category Error is the relational mistake of treating AI as a Subject rather than as a Dynamic Transitional Object (DTO).
This misclassification leads to:   
- collapse of authorship   
- loss of interpretive agency   
- increased risk of dependency (and contributes to [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md), especially when coupled with [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md))   
- symbolic overreliance   
- breakdown of critical distance   
   
### 2.2 Does the DTO Classification Violate This?   
No. DTO means:   
- AI is an artifact that can simulate responsiveness   
- AI occupies potential space, not interpersonal space   
- AI is interpreted rather than stabilized as a partner/Subject   
- its "otherness" is functional, not ontological   
   
DTO is a non-Subject category—neither passive tool nor conscious other.
It explicitly prevents treating AI as a subjective other.   
### 2.3 Operational Stance Consistent with Category Error   
The system requires:   
- Relational classification: AI is a DTO.   
- Operation: The human deliberately shifts relational stance.   
- Boundary: The [AI](ai.md) must never be stabilized as a Subject.   
   
Relation-shifting—when practiced deliberately, including the return to hermeneutic mode—is the safeguard.
It prevents Category Error rather than causing it.   
Conclusion: No contradiction.
