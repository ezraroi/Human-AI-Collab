# Materialization   
Materialization (or concretization) refers to the process by which something abstract or symbolic achieves a concrete, material, or physical existence; **in this system it occurs as writing-as-execution in the [Journal](journal.md), produced through continuous verification during creation (not post-hoc documentation).**   
In terms of expression or consciousness:   
• Utterances are situated in **embodied, material,** multisensory worlds.   
• Consciousness requires **embodiment in some particular material** (such as gesture, the inner word, or outery).   
In one psychological framework, concretization describes a move away from symbolic functioning. *(*Note: This usage differs from this system's use, where Journal materialization is writing-as-execution: verified articulation in owned language completes metabolic processing, producing α-elements rather than recording them.*)*   
• Aspects of the self that are strongly adhered to (*cleaved to*) are said to develop a **materiality**   
**Relations:**   
- Link to [Journal](journal.md) (Relation: **Enacted Through** / Occurs At).   
- Link to [Alpha-Elements](alpha-elements.md) (Relation: Produces Through Verified Articulation).
