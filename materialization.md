# Materialization   
**Materialization** (or *concretization*) refers to the process by which something abstract or symbolic achieves a **concrete, material, or physical existence**.   
In terms of expression or consciousness:   
• Utterances are situated in **embodied, material,** multisensory worlds.   
• Consciousness requires **embodiment in some particular material** (such as gesture, the inner word, or outery).   
• In one psychological framework, *concretization* (also called beta activity) describes a move away from symbolic functioning.   
• Aspects of the self that are strongly adhered to (*cleaved to*) are said to develop a **materiality**
