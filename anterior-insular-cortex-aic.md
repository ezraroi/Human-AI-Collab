# Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)   
The hub of the Salience Network. It is central to Interoception and Prediction Error detection. A "tight/spacious" felt signal can function as an interoceptive discriminator during embodied verification.   
The Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC), often referred to as the anterior insula (AI), is a critical brain structure folded deep within the lateral sulcus of each cerebral hemisphere. Functionally, the AIC is recognized as a component of the **Salience Network (SN)**, where it often works alongside the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Within this framework, the AIC acts as a **fast-acting flexible hub** that detects internal and external stimuli deemed biologically or cognitively relevant. It plays a role in dynamically switching the brain's focus between internal, self-referential processes (like the Default Mode Network) and external, cognitively demanding processes (like the Central Executive Network).   
The primary and most critical role of the AIC is in **interoceptive attention**, which is the capacity of the nervous system to sense, interpret, and integrate physiological signals arising from the internal body. Anatomical evidence confirms the AIC is essential for encoding and representing this interoceptive information. The AIC integrates raw sensory input, often received hierarchically from the posterior insula, with emotional salience and cognitive information from areas like the prefrontal cortex. This integration is what creates **subjective and conscious awareness** of the body's internal condition and feelings. Studies involving patients with focal AIC lesions provide causal evidence that the AIC is necessary for accurate interoceptive discrimination and sensitivity.   
Beyond internal awareness, the AIC is heavily implicated in high-level cognitive processes, particularly in **risk appraisal and decision-making**. The right AIC is associated with the prediction of adverse outcomes and is involved in integrating informative messages into the evaluation of options during decision-making. As a component of the Salience Network, the AIC contributes to cognitive control by detecting behaviorally salient events (such as stop signals) and promoting inhibitory control. The overarching function of the AIC is to convey bodily information into internal feelings which, in turn, guide decision-making and are fundamental for maintaining homeostasis.   
**Notes:** Neural substrate of interoception and embodied verification; supports Channel 1.
