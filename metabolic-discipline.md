# Metabolic Discipline   
Metabolic Discipline is the **operational stance** of the practitioner: the deliberate refusal to bypass the friction of [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) even when AI offers effortless fluency.   
It is the commitment to **embodied verification** over symbolic convenience.   
### System Role   
- Sustains early engagement **before** the [flywheel](the-flywheel.md) of C-growth takes hold.   
- Protects against [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) by forcing symbolic material through the body’s friction mechanism.   
- Maintains authorship by ensuring that meaning formation remains internal, not outsourced.   
- Functions as the ethical core of reflective AI practice.   
   
### Core Stance   
> “I will not confuse fluency with understanding. I will metabolize everything through my own embodied system.”   

### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Implemented By:**   
    - [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md)   
    - [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md)   
    - Touch Grass Protocol (boundary management)   
- **Guards Against:** [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Supports:** Channel 1 activation and Alpha-Function engagement   
   
**Notes:** Volitional stance of refusing symbolic bypass; protects against PSB.
