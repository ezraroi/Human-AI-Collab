# Internally Persuasive Discourse   
Information or guidance that is internalized through genuine understanding and ownership, rather than coercion. It can serve as linguistic material for the [True Self](true-self.md) when verified through [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md).   
**Verification:** You know discourse is "internally persuasive" when it resonates with the **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)**, causing a "[Felt Shift](felt-shift.md)"   
**Notes:** AI/human articulation that resonates with Felt Sense.
