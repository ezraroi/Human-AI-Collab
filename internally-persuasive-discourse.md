# Internally Persuasive Discourse   
**Definition:** Information or guidance that is internalized through genuine understanding and responsive collaboration, rather than coercion. It is the linguistic building block of the **[True Self](true-self.md)**.   
**Verification:** You know discourse is "internally persuasive" when it resonates with the **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)**, causing a "[Felt Shift](felt-shift.md)"
