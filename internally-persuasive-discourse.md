# Internally Persuasive Discourse   
Information or guidance that is internalized through genuine understanding and ownership, rather than coercion. It can serve as linguistic material that **supports idiom articulation (as an expression of the [True Self](true-self.md))** when verified through Felt Sense.   
**Verification:** You know discourse is "internally persuasive" when it resonates with the **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)**, causing a "[Felt Shift](felt-shift.md)"   
**Notes:** AI/human articulation that resonates with [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md).
