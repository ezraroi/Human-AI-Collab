# 7. What Would Falsify or Strongly Constrain the Mapping   
Examples of constraining outcomes:   
- No meaningful differences between AI, human, and solo conditions on proposed discriminators.   
- “Felt shift” events do not correlate with any consistent physiology or network-dynamic markers.   
- Reward/relief markers correlate with “feels better” but show no relationship to ownership/persistence.   
- Physiological regulation improves without corresponding durable behavioral change (suggesting generic soothing rather than transformation).   
- Durable change occurs with no evidence of the hypothesized integration dynamics (forcing alternative mechanisms).   
   
This agenda is successful if it forces the model to become more precise, not if it confirms it.
