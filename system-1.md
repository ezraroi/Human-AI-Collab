# System 1   
System 1 is one part of [Daniel Kahneman](daniel-kahneman.md)’s dual-process framework, representing the intuitive, fast, and automatic thinking process within the human mind.   
Key characteristics:   
- **Speed and Nature:** It is described as reactive, quick, and holistic   
- **Mechanism:** Thinking in System 1 heavily relies on heuristics (cognitive maneuvers), readily associated ideas, key situational characteristics, and vivid memories to arrive quickly and confidently at a judgment.   
   
• **Application:** It is particularly useful in **familiar situations when time is short** and immediate action is required.   
• **Context:** It functions alongside **[System 2](system-2.md)** (the more deliberative, reflective, and analytical thinking system). It is part of the integrated model of human decision-making. In human-AI collaboration, users may default to System 1 (fast acceptance or fast dismissal of AI suggestions) when engaging [System 2](system-2.md) feels too effortful; this can manifest as over-reliance or under-trust depending on the user’s posture and context.   
**Example:**   
If you’re running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?   
For many, the instant answer that pops into mind is "first place." That’s System 1 jumping to a plausible but incorrect conclusion. If you pause and engage System 2, you'll realize that if you pass the person in second, you take their place. You are now in second place.
