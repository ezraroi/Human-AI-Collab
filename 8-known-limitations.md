# 8. Known Limitations   
### What the Formula Captures Well   
- Structural dependencies between components   
- Multiplicative relationship of scaffolds   
- Inverse relationship to challenge   
- U-curve of challenge gap   
- Bottleneck identification in failures   
- Pattern recognition across contexts   
   
### Future Evolution Possibilities   
Potential refinements (not commitments):   
- Explicit embodiment term: E   
- Time dependency notation: P(α, t)   
- Journal function: J as multiplier   
- Verification confidence: V as parameter   
   
Current position:   
- Formula is powerful as-is for its purpose   
- Additional complexity may obscure core insights   
- Let practical application guide evolution   
- Document tensions rather than forcing resolution
