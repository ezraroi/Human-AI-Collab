# 3. Diagnostic Workflow   
**Step A: Identify the dominant mismatch type**   
[D](d-difficulty.md) is multidimensional. Identify which dimension is primary:   
|                             Dimension |                                           Characteristics |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
|                  Cognitive complexity | Novel concepts, technical difficulty, information density |
|                           Affect load |       Emotional intensity, threat, vulnerability required |
| [Identity stakes](identity-stakes.md) |          Self-concept challenged, core beliefs questioned |
|                               Novelty |       Distance from existing schema, unfamiliar territory |

Often multiple dimensions are active. Identify which is primary—this determines calibration.   
**Step B: Assess field viability (qualitative)**   
|      State |                                                                                 Indicators |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Viable | Scaffolding feels matched to challenge; productive tension present; engagement sustainable |
|   Marginal |                      Strain visible; one constraint close to threshold; requires attention |
| Non-viable |            At least one constraint violated; metabolization blocked; intervention required |

This is felt assessment, not measurement.   
**Step C: Name the failure pattern**   
|                               Pattern |                                              Core Diagnosis |
|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
|     [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) |             Experienced mismatch bypassed before engagement |
|                             Overwhelm |                           Mismatch >> available scaffolding |
|                       Safety Collapse |              S\_e → 0; non-substitutability collapses field |
|                        Technical Void |                  S\_t → 0; safety present but directionless |
|                               Boredom |                               C >> D; no productive tension |
| [Manic Episode](the-manic-episode.md) |              Actual S\_e depletion + hallucinated viability |
|   [Category Error](category-error.md) | Axiom violation; false viability via corrupted verification |

Naming enables pattern recognition across contexts.   
**Step D: Choose the intervention lever**   
|                                                          Lever |                                                                                                         When to Use |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Protect [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) | Safety collapsed or marginal; reduce noise, interruptions, environmental stressors; come to sessions more resourced |
| Increase [Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) |                                                                        Direction/structure missing; guidance needed |
|                                                   Reduce Scope |                                                       Gap unbridgeable; decompose into smaller, workable challenges |
|                                                Restore Posture |                                                           Category Error present; axiom violation must be addressed |
|                  Stop ([Touch Grass](touch-grass-protocol.md)) |                                                               S\_e depleted; mandatory withdrawal before continuing |
