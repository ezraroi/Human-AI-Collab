# 4. Calibration Playbook   
The core control principle: Scaffolding is meaningful only relative to the [challenge gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md). Different gaps (size and type) require different levels and kinds of scaffolding.   
**Dimension 1: Quantity**   
How much scaffolding is needed?   
- Larger/more threatening gaps require strengthening holding and/or structure **in a way that preserves non-substitutability** (one cannot replace the other).   
- But more is not always better—excessive scaffolding can eliminate challenge (→ PSB)   
- The target is "enough to keep mismatch workable" not "as much as possible"   
   
**Dimension 2: Type**   
What kind of scaffolding matches this mismatch?   
|         Dominant Mismatch |                                                                         Scaffolding Priority |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          High affect load |             Prioritize Sₑ first (holding before guidance); then introduce Sₜ once contained. |
| High cognitive complexity |     Prioritize Sₜ (structure before reassurance), while keeping Sₑ sufficient for tolerance. |
|      High identity stakes |                                                           Both required; Sₑ is prerequisite. |
|              High novelty |                                         Technical Scaffolding (Sₜ) within a safe field (Sₑ). |

Mismatching type to need is a common failure. Adding structure ([S\_t](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)) when the problem is emotional (needs [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)) cannot work—non-substitutability.   
**Dimension 3: Timing**   
When does scaffolding arrive?   
|     Timing |                                                                                                                    Result |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Too early |   Challenge eliminated before struggle recruits [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) (→ [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) |
|   Too late |                                                                               Overwhelm has already occurred; damage done |
| Just right |                                                       Struggle activates metabolic pressure; scaffolding enables bridging |

The "just right" moment: user has engaged the challenge, felt the pressure, begun metabolizing—then scaffolding supports the bridging without replacing the work.   
Timing applies mainly to **technical scaffolding (Sₜ)**: Sₑ should be present from entry, while Sₜ must avoid preemptive completion.   
**Dimension 4: Withdrawal**   
How does **technical guidance and external structuring (Sₜ)** withdraw as [Capacity](c-capacity.md) grows (while maintaining sufficient Sₑ)   
- Successful metabolization increases C   
- If scaffolding remains constant while C grows, experienced mismatch shrinks   
- Shrinking mismatch → reduced metabolic pressure → stagnation risk   
- Gradual withdrawal maintains productive tension as capacity develops   
   
This is the [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) growth enables tolerance for greater challenge, which enables further growth.   
Bidirectionality:   
Scaffolding doesn't just "help with" objective difficulty. It modulates experienced mismatch:   
- Good S\_e makes difficulty feel holdable (threat reduced)   
- Good S\_t makes complexity feel navigable (structure provided)   
   
Same objective [D](d-difficulty.md) can produce different experienced mismatch depending on scaffolding configuration. This is why calibration is relational, not fixed.
