# Narrative Self   
The story constructed from memories, traits, roles, and goals. It is the identity we describe to others and ourselves.
**System Role:** This is the Object of Transformation: the constructed self-story that can be revised as **idiom articulation (as an expression of the [True Self](true-self.md))** becomes possible.
**Interface:** The  materializes the Narrative Self so the  can verify it.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to `[Journal](journal.md)` (Relation: `Materialized In`).   
- Link to  `[Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md)` (Relation: Becomes Articulated As).   
   
Notes: Identity-level narrative structure reshaped by [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) as [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) becomes phenomenologically articulated **as idiom expression (of the True Self)**
