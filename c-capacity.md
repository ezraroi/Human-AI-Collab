# C (Capacity)   
**Definition:** The learner's current psychic structure, skills, and store of processed alpha-elements.   
**Dynamics:**   
- **Growth:** Occurs between sessions if transformation happened.   
- **Atrophy:** Occurs if the challenge gap is consistently removed (as in [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)).   
   
**System Role:** This is the variable that actually grows. It resides in the **[Human](human.md)** subject   
[P(alpha) (Probability of Growth)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md)
