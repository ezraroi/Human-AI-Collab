# C (Capacity)   
The user’s current psychic structure, cognitive skills, and accumulated store of processed **[alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)** (metabolized insights). **C** is the developmental substrate that grows (or atrophies) over time — what the Human has become capable of.   
## Schema Role   
**C pairs with D ([Difficulty](d-difficulty.md)) to form [mismatch(D, C)](challenge-gap-d-c.md)** in the [**Field Viability Schema**:](field-viability-schema.md)   
> (S_e ⊗ S_t) calibrated to mismatch(D, C), such that experienced mismatch remains in a workable range.   

- **C** = what you can handle independently *now*   
- **D** = what the task / experience demands   
- **mismatch(D, C)** = the **experienced/effective challenge gap** that scaffolding must be calibrated to; its workable band becomes the [ZPD](zpd.md) under guidance.   
   
## What C Comprises   
1. **Psychic Structure**   
- Internalized frameworks for meaning-making   
- Cognitive schemas and mental models   
- Emotional regulation capacity   
- Complexity tolerance   
2. **Processed α-Elements**   
- Insights previously metabolized and materialized   
- Knowledge transformed from [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) → [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)   
- Conceptual understanding (not just information)   
- Integrated, owned knowledge   
3. **Skills & Capacities**   
- Ability to hold ambiguity ([Negative Capability](negative-capability.md))   
- Metabolic processing efficiency   
- Pattern recognition across domains   
- Self-regulation capabilities   
4. **Identity Integration**   
- [True Self](true-self.md) emergence   
- Idiom articulation   
- Authentic agency   
- Coherent self-narrative   
   
## Critical Properties   
### Resides only in the [Human](human.md)   
- C cannot exist in AI (no developmental substrate)   
- C cannot exist in the [Journal](journal.md) (Journal stores/materializes; it doesn’t “grow”)   
- C is embodied, living structure in the human psyche   
- Only the Human’s C can increase or atrophy   
   
### Cross-temporal, not turn-by-turn   
- **Within-session:** C is relatively stable   
- **Between sessions:** C grows or atrophies depending on whether metabolization occurred   
- **Across time:** C changes through accumulation + consolidation   
   
## Growth Dynamics   
### C increases when transformation occurred   
- [Alpha-function](alpha-function.md) was recruited (β → α metabolization)   
- Dual-channel integration occurred (symbolic ↔ embodied)   
- Material was **inscribed** in the Journal (durability / prevents regression)   
- Consolidation occurred across Time (spacing, sleep, integration)   
- Result: higher C in future work → can carry greater D without overwhelm   
   
**Observable markers of C growth**   
- Increased complexity tolerance   
- Deeper Negative Capability   
- Can explain concepts in own words (not just repeat fluent outputs)   
- Previously overwhelming material becomes workable   
- “Spacious” felt sense more accessible   
- Greater self-regulation capacity   
   
## Atrophy / Stagnation Dynamics   
### C decreases or stagnates when metabolization is repeatedly bypassed   
- **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) pattern sustained:** experienced mismatch is **repeatedly bypassed before engagement**   
- The underlying gap between D and C may still exist — but it is not *encountered* metabolically   
- Passive consumption replaces metabolization   
- Result: lower C over time → increased dependency on external processing   
   
**Observable markers of C atrophy**   
- Reduced complexity tolerance   
- Increased dependency on AI   
- Cannot reproduce reasoning independently   
- Previously manageable tasks feel harder   
- Lowered Negative Capability   
- Tighter baseline felt sense   
   
## System Dependencies   
C growth typically requires:   
1. **Alpha-Function activation**   
- Metabolic processing occurred (β → α)   
- Cannot be replaced by fluency (PSB blocks growth)   
2. **Journal materialization (when the work carries Identity Stakes)**   
- Insights inscribed, not ephemeral   
- Prevents regression   
- Enables pattern recognition across time   
- Without Journal: growth may occur locally but won’t reliably accumulate   
3. **[Time](time.md) / consolidation**   
- Between-session spacing for integration   
- Sleep-dependent consolidation   
- Without Time: insights don’t stabilize   
4. **Field viability conditions**   
- **S\_e ⊗ S\_t** must be calibrated so experienced mismatch remains workable   
- If experienced mismatch is **bypassed** → PSB → no growth   
- If experienced mismatch is **unbridgeable** → overwhelm → no growth   
- If D is trivial relative to C → boredom / no metabolic pressure   
   
## Observable Markers   
**High / growing C**   
- More stable spaciousness baseline   
- Comfort with higher complexity   
- Self-explanation fluency in own idiom   
- Negative Capability maintained   
- Can revisit past insights and extend them   
- Journal entries show deepening sophistication   
- Identity coherence increasing   
   
**Low / atrophying C**   
- Tight baseline felt sense   
- Reduced complexity tolerance   
- Dependency on external processing   
- Cannot explain in own words   
- Repeating the same conceptual level   
- Journal entries shallow or AI-derivative   
- Identity fragmentation or [False Self](false-self.md) dominance   
   
## Relations (Wiring)   
- Paired With: **D (Difficulty)** to form **mismatch(D, C)**   
- Resides In: **Human** (only location where C can exist/grow)   
- Grows Through: **Alpha-Function activation**, **Journal materialization**, **Time consolidation**   
- Atrophies Through: **PSB** (experienced mismatch repeatedly bypassed), chronic non-metabolization   
- Manifests In: flywheel effect (cumulative momentum), ability to engage higher D over time   
- Indicated By: complexity tolerance, Negative Capability, [self-explanation](self-explanation.md) in own words   
- Supported By: Journal (persistence), Time (consolidation), viable field conditions   
   
## Notes   
C is what actually changes — what transformation *means* in the Human.   
- **S\_e ⊗ S\_t** provide enabling conditions   
- **D** provides challenge   
- **mismatch(D, C)** provides metabolically relevant tension   
- The **Field Viability Schema** describes whether conditions enable transformation   
- **C** is the outcome that accumulates over time   
   
Your **43 notebooks** function as documentary evidence of accumulation: durable traces that make growth (and regressions) visible across time, and make pattern recognition possible.
