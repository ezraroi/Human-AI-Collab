# C (Capacity)   
The user’s current developmental substrate: psychic structure, cognitive skills, and accumulated store of **processed [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)** (metabolized, owned meanings). C is what the Human has become capable of **over time**—the primary variable that grows (or can stagnate/atrophy) across repeated Recursive Metabolic Loop cycles.   
### Schema Role   
C pairs with D (Difficulty) to form mismatch(D, C) in the[ Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md):   
> (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ) calibrated to mismatch(D, C), such that experienced mismatch remains in a workable range.   

- **C** = what you can handle independently (baseline capacity)   
- **D** = what the task / experience demands   
- mismatch(D, C) = the effective [challenge gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md) (often treated as **\|D–C\|** at the heuristic level) that scaffolding must calibrate into a workable band ([ZPD](zpd.md) under guidance)   
   
### What C Comprises   
**Psychic Structure**   
- Internalized meaning-making frameworks   
- Emotional regulation capacity   
- Complexity tolerance   
- Internalized containment / ambiguity holding   
   
**Processed α-Elements**   
- Previously metabolized and owned meanings   
- Insights that are **reconstructable** (not just remembered or repeated)   
- Integrated knowledge (not raw information or fluent phrasing)   
   
**Skills & Capacities**   
- [Negative Capability](negative-capability.md) (holding not-knowing)   
- Metabolic processing efficiency (β → α)   
- Pattern recognition across domains   
- Self-explanation capacity in one’s idiom   
   
**Identity Integration**   
- [True Self](true-self.md) emergence and reduced [False Self](false-self.md) dominance   
- Idiom articulation   
- Authentic agency   
- Coherent self-narrative (owned, not imitative)   
   
### Critical Properties   
### Resides only in the Human   
- C cannot exist in AI (no developmental substrate)   
- C cannot exist in the Journal (the Journal stores/materializes; it does not “grow”)   
- Only the Human’s C can increase, stagnate, or atrophy   
   
### Cross-temporal, not turn-by-turn   
- Within-session: baseline C is relatively stable   
- Between sessions: C changes through accumulation + consolidation   
   
### Growth Dynamics   
### C increases when transformation occurred   
- [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) was recruited (β → α)   
- Dual-channel integration occurred ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) ↔ [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md))   
- Materialization occurred in an appropriate substrate   
    - [Identity stakes](identity-stakes.md) → Journal is paradigmatic   
    - Professional/creative → code, artifact, decision practice, etc.   
- Consolidation occurred across Time (spacing/sleep/re-entry)   
   
**Result:** higher future C → can carry higher D without overwhelm; reduced dependency on external processing.   
**Observable markers of C growth**   
- Increased complexity tolerance under load   
- Deeper Negative Capability   
- Can re-derive and explain in own idiom (no karaoke voice)   
- Previously overwhelming material becomes workable   
- Spaciousness / “this lands” becomes **more accessible during challenge**   
- Improved self-regulation and return-to-baseline after sessions   
- Stronger withdrawal-probe performance (can reconstruct without AI)   
   
### Stagnation / Atrophy Dynamics   
### C stagnates when metabolization is repeatedly bypassed   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) pattern sustained: experienced mismatch bypassed before metabolic engagement   
- Passive consumption replaces metabolization   
- Result: less accumulation; repeated need to re-consume coherence   
   
### C can atrophy when bypass becomes chronic and replaces independent processing   
- Reliance displaces practice of metabolic labor   
- Reasoning becomes less reconstructable without external scaffolding   
- Identity-level integration weakens (increased False Self compliance risk)   
   
**Observable markers of stagnation/atrophy**   
- Reduced complexity tolerance   
- Increased dependency on AI for meaning/decision processing   
- Cannot reproduce reasoning independently   
- Previously manageable tasks feel harder   
- Lower Negative Capability   
- “Tight” or “hollow” quality more frequent; less embodied verification access   
- Journal entries shallow or AI-derivative (identity work)   
   
### System Dependencies   
C growth typically requires:   
1. **Alpha-Function activation** (β → α metabolization)   
2. **[Materialization](materialization.md)** ([Journal](journal.md) for identity stakes; other substrates as appropriate)   
3. **[Time](time.md) / consolidation** (spacing, sleep, integration; re-entry test)   
4. **Field viability** (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ calibrated to mismatch(D, Cᵃᵛᵃⁱˡ))   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- Paired With: D ([Difficulty](d-difficulty.md)) → mismatch(D, C)   
- Resides In: [Human](human.md)   
- Grows Through: Alpha-Function, materialization, [Time](time.md) consolidation, re-entry success   
- Stagnates/Atrophies Through: PSB (bypass), chronic non-metabolization, displaced practice   
- Supported By: Journal (chronotope/persistence), Time (consolidation), viable field conditions   
- Manifests In: [Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) effect; ability to engage higher D over time   
   
### Notes   
C is what actually changes—what “transformation” means in the Human.
Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ are enabling conditions; D supplies challenge; mismatch(D, C) provides metabolically relevant tension. Field Viability determines whether a given iteration can run. C is the accumulating outcome across Time.
