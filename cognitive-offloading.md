# Cognitive Offloading   
The use of physical action (like writing) or external tools (like AI) to alter the information processing requirements of a task so as to reduce cognitive demand.   
**The Crucial Distinction (Notebook 5):**
Offloading is not inherently good or bad; it depends on *what* is offloaded.   
- **Passive Offloading:** Offloading the *processing* (the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)). This leads to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** and atrophy.   
- **Strategic Offloading:** Offloading the *lower-level retrieval/storage* to maximize "Germane Load" (productive effort) on the Architect's goals. This enables **Flow Optimization**.   
   
Use AI when in **[High Resolution Uncertainty](high-resolution-uncertainty.md)** (to maximize Germane Load). Avoid AI when in **Low Resolution Uncertainty** (increase resolution solo first) or **False Certainty** (use AI as challenger)   
**🔗 Relations (The Wiring):   
- **Link to:** `[Extended Mind Hypothesis (HEC)](extended-mind-hypothesis-hec.md)` (Relation: *Mechanism Of*).   
- **Link to:** `[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)` (Relation: *Optimizes*).   
   
**Notes:** Offloading reduces extraneous load; dangerous if metabolization is offloaded.
