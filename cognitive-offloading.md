# Cognitive Offloading   
The use of physical action (like writing) or external tools (like AI) to alter the information processing requirements of a task so as to reduce cognitive demand.   
**The Crucial Distinction (Notebook 5):**
Offloading is not inherently good or bad; it depends on *what* is offloaded.   
- **Passive Offloading:** Offloading the *processing* (the [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)). This leads to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** and atrophy.   
- **Strategic Offloading:** Offloading the *lower-level retrieval/storage* to maximize "Germane Load" (productive effort) on the Architect's goals. This enables **Flow Optimization**.   
   
Use AI when you have [High-Resolution Uncertainty](high-resolution-uncertainty.md) (granular awareness of what you know/don’t know) so offloading supports germane work rather than replacing it. Avoid AI when uncertainty is low-resolution (‘I’m lost/overwhelmed’) until you regain granularity, or when in False Certainty (use AI as challenger).   
**🔗 Relations (The Wiring):   
- **Link to:** `[Extended Mind Hypothesis (HEC)](extended-mind-hypothesis-hec.md)` (Relation: Theoretical Basis For).   
- **Link to:** `[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)` (Relation: *Optimizes*).   
   
**Notes:** Offloading reduces extraneous load; dangerous if metabolization is offloaded.
