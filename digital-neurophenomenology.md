# Digital Neurophenomenology   
Digital Neurophenomenology is the epistemic stance of the Third Intelligence research: an adaptation of Varela’s neurophenomenology to AI-mediated dialogue that legitimates first-person transformation data as credible research material.   
### The Structural Mapping   
|        Position |                                                  Provider |                                                                            Function |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1st-Person (1P) |                                         [Human](human.md) |                            Raw, lived, pre-reflective experience (“hiker’s report”) |
| 3rd-Person (3P) | [AI](ai.md) (+ [Journal](journal.md) as return substrate) |     Structural constraint: logic, coherence checking, candidate frames (“mapmaker”) |

### Critical Clarification: What 3P Means Here   
3P is not empirical measurement. AI provides structural constraint (objectification, coherence checking, candidate frames), not lab-grade third-person data. Empirical 3P validation remains part of the research agenda, not a claim already satisfied.   
### Role Integrity   
Transformation requires role preservation:   
- Human stays **hiker**: provides raw felt experience, embodied verification   
- AI stays **mapmaker**: provides structural constraint, never simulates subjectivity   
   
Failure when roles swap:   
|         Role Violation |                                     Failure Mode |                               Wires To |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Human becomes mapmaker |            Intellectualization / embodied bypass | [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk |
|       AI becomes hiker | Hallucinated subjectivity / anthropomorphization |    [Category Error](category-error.md) |

**[Two-Axis mapping](two-axis-framework.md):** Role integrity corresponds to Two-Axis success.   
- Human stays hiker = Axis A ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance) + Axis B (embodied verification) maintained   
- Human→mapmaker swap = Axis B failure (PSB pathway)   
- AI→hiker swap = Axis A failure (Category Error)   
   
**Grounded in:** Protected Self-Holding Principle. “Human stays hiker” means the human maintains the container function—providing raw felt experience and embodied verification. When this role is abandoned (becoming mapmaker), self-holding collapses into intellectualization.   
### What This Object Does (Scope)   
- Legitimates 1P phenomenological data as valid research material   
- Provides Varela-derived justification for methodological rigor   
- Specifies role constraints that preserve epistemic validity   
   
### What This Object Does NOT Do   
- Does not describe transformation mechanism (→ [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md), ICB)   
- Does not specify session method (→ Reflective Prompting)   
- Does not provide validation procedure (→ HSCED, Triangulation)   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- Derived From → [Francisco Varela](francisco-varela.md) (Neurophenomenology)   
- Methodology Of → [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) Research Design   
- Enacted Through → [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md); [Journal](journal.md) (**verified [materialization](materialization.md) / return substrate**)   
- Constrained By → [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ)   
- Role Integrity Grounded In → [Protected Self-Holding Principle](protected-self-holding-principle.md)   
- Maps To → Two-Axis Framework (role preservation = viable quadrant)   
- Distinct From → [HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md) (validation), [ICB](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) (architecture)   
- Failure Modes → PSB (role swap: Human→mapmaker), Category Error (role swap: AI→hiker)   
   
### Notes   
Digital Neurophenomenology is the epistemic legitimation layer, not the operational mechanism. It answers “why is 1P data valid?” not “how does transformation work?” The mutual constraint between 1P and structural 3P creates conditions under which phenomenological data becomes credible without requiring lab-grade empirical measurement.
