# Digital Neurophenomenology   
The **epistemic stance** of the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) research: an adaptation
of [Varela](francisco-varela.md)'s neurophenomenology to AI-mediated dialogue that legitimates
first-person transformation data as credible research material.   
### The Structural Mapping   
|            Position |     Provider |                                                                  Function |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1st-Person (1P)** |        Human |                  Raw, lived, pre-reflective experience ("hiker's report") |
| **3rd-Person (3P)** | AI + Journal | Structural constraint: logic, coherence, pattern recognition ("mapmaker") |

### Critical Clarification: What 3P Means Here   
**3P is not empirical measurement.** AI provides *structural constraint*
(objectification, coherence checking, candidate frames), not lab-grade
third-person data. Empirical 3P validation remains part of the research
agenda, not a claim already satisfied.   
### Role Integrity (Hard Requirement)   
Transformation requires **role preservation**:   
- **Human stays hiker:** Provides raw felt experience, embodied verification   
- **AI stays mapmaker:** Provides structural constraint, never simulates subjectivity   
   
**Failure when roles swap:**   
|         Role Violation |                                     Failure Mode |                               Wires To |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| Human becomes mapmaker |            Intellectualization / embodied bypass | [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk |
|       AI becomes hiker | Hallucinated subjectivity / anthropomorphization |    [Category Error](category-error.md) |

### What This Object Does (Scope)   
- Legitimates 1P phenomenological data as valid research material   
- Provides Varela-derived justification for methodological rigor   
- Specifies role constraints that preserve epistemic validity   
   
### What This Object Does NOT Do   
- Does not describe transformation mechanism (→ Alpha-Function, ICB)   
- Does not specify session method (→ Reflective Prompting)   
- Does not provide validation procedure (→ HSCED, Triangulation)   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- **Derived From →** [Francisco Varela](francisco-varela.md) (Neurophenomenology)   
- **Methodology Of →** [Third Intelligence ](third-intelligence.md)Research Design   
- **Enacted Through →** [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md), [Journal](journal.md) ([Materialization](materialization.md))   
- **Constrained By →** [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ)   
- **Distinct From →** HSCED (validation), ICB (architecture)   
- **Failure Modes →** PSB (role swap: Human→mapmaker), Category Error (role swap: AI→hiker)   
   
### Notes   
Digital Neurophenomenology is the *epistemic legitimation layer*, not the
*operational mechanism*. It answers "why is 1P data valid?" not "how does
transformation work?" The mutual constraint between 1P and 3P creates the
conditions under which phenomenological data becomes credible without
requiring lab-grade empirical measurement.
