# Digital Neurophenomenology   
**Definition:** The methodological stance of the system. It adapts the framework of Neurophenomenology (integrating first-person experience with third-person data) to the Human-AI context.
**The Structural Mapping:**   
- **1st-Person (1P):** The  provides the raw, lived, pre-reflective experience (the "hiker's report").   
- **3rd-Person (3P):** The  provides the structural, logical, and objective constraint (the "mapmaker").
The Mechanism: **Mutual Circulation**. Transformation occurs not in one side, but in the reciprocal constraints between the messy subjectivity of the user and the rigid structure of the AI.   
   
**Notes:** Methodological stance integrating 1P + 3P through AI mediation.
