# Hubert Hermans   
Provides the **Continuity**.
***Dialogical Self Theory:** The self as a multiplicity of "I-positions".
***Continuity & Memory:** Provided by the **[Journal](journal.md)** to solve the "AI has no memory" paradox.   
Hubert Hermans (born 1937) is a Dutch psychologist and Emeritus Professor at Radboud University of Nijmegen, best known as the creator of **Dialogical Self Theory (DST)**. He is a leading figure in narrative psychology and has been recognized as a pioneer in understanding the human psyche through the lens of internal dialogue and the self as a "society of mind".   
Key Contributions   
- **Dialogical Self Theory (DST):** Hermans' primary contribution, which posits that the self is a dynamic multiplicity of "I-positions" that engage in dialogue with each other, much like different characters in a novel. These positions can be internal (e.g., "I as a dedicated professional") or external (e.g., "my mother's voice in me"), and their interactions (dialogical or monological) shape an individual's identity and experience.   
- **Self-Confrontation Method (SCM):** An idiographic assessment and therapeutic method he developed with his first wife, Els Hermans-Jansen, that helps clients explore their different "I-positions" and emotional valuations to facilitate change. This method involves formulating personal narratives and analyzing the associated affects to understand the organization of the self.   
- **Narrative Psychology:** Hermans is a key figure in this field, emphasizing how individuals construct meaning in their lives through self-narratives and stories.   
- **Achievement Motivation Tests:** Earlier in his career, he developed widely used psychological tests in the Netherlands to measure achievement motivation in adults and children.   
- **International Society for Dialogical Science (ISDS):** He founded the ISDS and organized biennial international conferences to promote research and discussion on dialogical relationships within the self and between people and cultures.   
   
His work is considered an alternative to traditional individualistic and rationalistic views of the self, emphasizing instead the self's embeddedness in society and culture. For his scientific and societal merits, he was appointed a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 2002.
