# Felt Sense   
The somatic, bodily awareness of meaning. Used to verify "[Internally Persuasive Discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md)"   
This is a [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) signal used within [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing   
The "Felt Sense," a term coined by [Eugene Gendlin](eugene-gendlin.md), refers to a **physical (bodily) awareness** of a specific situation, problem, or concern.   
Simply put:   
• It is a **physical sense of meaning**—an internal aura or holistic, yet unclear, sense of everything you feel and know about a subject at a given time, communicating this complexity all at once.   
• It is often described as **vague, fuzzy, or murky** until one focuses on it, and it is **not the same as an emotion**, but is bigger and more complex than any single emotion.   
• It is considered an **unclear edge** or the implicit dimension underlying conscious understanding.   
**Notes:** Channel 1 interpretive root.
