# Teleological Drift   
**Definition:** The tendency of the [Human](human.md) "Architect" to lose the global goal due to fatigue, mania or any other reason such as [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) usage. The AI is "myopic" (next token only), so the Human must provide **Non-Myopic Awareness**.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Human](human.md)** (Relation: `Risk Factor For`).   
   
   
**Notes:** Human loses the global goal; AI cannot provide teleology.
