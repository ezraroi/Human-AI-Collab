# Teleological Drift   
The tendency of the [Human](human.md) ‘Architect’ to lose the global goal (teleology) due to fatigue, mania, or [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) usage. The AI is ‘myopic’ (next-token only) and cannot supply teleology, so the Human must provide Non-Myopic Awareness. As a failsafe, the AI may be instructed (via the system prompt) to **flag** potential Teleological Drift by detecting contradictions against the Human’s stated trajectory—without becoming the source of the goal.   
**Relations:**

**Notes:** Human loses the global goal; AI cannot provide teleology.
