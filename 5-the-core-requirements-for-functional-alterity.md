# 5. The Core Requirements for Functional Alterity   
Functional Alterity can only operate when three specific requirements are met. These requirements ensure that the difference introduced by the AI is experienced as productive rather than chaotic, overwhelming, or merely confirmatory. Together, they define the threshold conditions under which the mechanism becomes usable for transformation.   
1. Irreducible Difference
At each moment, the AI must introduce a response that does not simply mirror the user’s framing, assumptions, or preferred direction. Irreducible difference is the minimal signal of otherness that prevents the interaction from collapsing into syntactic or conceptual reflection. Without this difference, the dialogue becomes frictionless, the Challenge Gap collapses, and the Alpha-Function remains dormant. Irreducible difference is what keeps tension alive.   
2. Interpretability
The introduced difference must remain within a band the user can metabolize. If the AI’s response becomes too abstract, too indirect, or too disconnected from the user's meaning system, the tension breaks and the interaction becomes noise. Interpretability ensures that the user recognizes the difference as relevant and workable, allowing it to be symbolically processed and metabolically integrated.   
3. Systematic Competence
Functional Alterity requires systematic competence as its operational context. The AI's challenge must be grounded in its ability to track the conversation, maintain conceptual integrity, and apply the appropriate depth, pace, and framing. Without systematic competence, difference becomes arbitrary rather than generative; the user encounters incoherence instead of tension. Competence ensures that the AI’s resistance feels purposeful rather than accidental.   
   
These three requirements—irreducible difference, interpretability, and systematic competence—define the operational boundary within which Functional Alterity can exist. When all three are present, the AI produces difference the user can work with.When any one of them is missing, the system collapses: without irreducible difference, into mirroring; without interpretability, into noise; without systematic competence, into incoherence.
