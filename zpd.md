# ZPD   
The dynamically negotiated subset of the [Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md): the distance between what the person can do **independently** (Capacity) and what they can do **with guidance/collaboration** when Difficulty exceeds Capacity but remains achievable in the presence of adequate scaffolding. The functional arena where transformation becomes possible.   
**System Role**   
Provides the active workspace in which alpha-function can operate. Translation layer connecting your model to learning theory. Only exists when both scaffolds (emotional and technical) are sufficient, providing the **guidance/collaboration** function [Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md) attributes to a More Knowledgeable Other ([MKO](mko-more-knowledgeable-other.md)).   
**Relations**   
- Exists *within* the **[Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md)**   
- Becomes workable in the presence of [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ) and [Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) (Sₜ)   
- The zone in which [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) shapes how the [Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md) is encountered (without creating it)   
- Linked to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (site of ignition)   
[Lev Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)    
   
**Notes:** Active relational space where α-function ignites under optimal tension + scaffolding; classically, learning in this zone supports the shift from assisted performance toward independent capacity (internalization), consistent with ‘learning precedes development.
