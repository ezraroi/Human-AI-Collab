# ZPD   
The dynamically negotiated **subset of the Challenge Gap** where [Difficulty](d-difficulty.md) slightly exceeds [Capacity](c-capacity.md) in the presence of adequate scaffolding. The functional arena where transformation becomes possible.   
**System Role**   
Provides the **active workspace** in which alpha-function can operate. Translation layer connecting your model to learning theory. Only exists when both scaffolds (Sₑ, Sₜ) are sufficient.   
**Relations**   
- Exists *within* the **[Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md)**   
- Becomes workable in the presence of [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ) and [Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) (Sₜ)   
- The zone in which [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) shapes how the [Challenge Gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md) is encountered (without creating it)   
- Linked to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (site of ignition)   
[Lev Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)    
   
**Notes:** Active relational space where α-function ignites under optimal tension + scaffolding.
