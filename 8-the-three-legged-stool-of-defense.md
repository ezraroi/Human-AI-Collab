# 8. The Three-Legged Stool of Defense   
The methodology must stand on three supports:   
### Theoretical Specifiability (Analytic Generalization)   
- Claim: "The Alpha-Function mechanism operates via Functional Alterity"   
- Evidence: Mapping dialogue logs to Bionian model (theory-matching)   
- Standard: Does the case illuminate how the theory operates at individual level?   
   
### Temporal Consistency (Longitudinal Rigor)   
- Claim: "This is stable structural change, not state change"   
- Evidence: 43-notebook timeline showing evolution of narrative and capacity   
- Standard: Do patterns persist across time? Do withdrawal phases show expected dynamics?   
   
### Adjudicated Falsification (Critical Testing)   
- Claim: "The result is not confirmation bias"   
- Evidence: Documented manic episodes, moments of disagreement, system failures   
- Standard: Has the researcher actively sought and documented counter-evidence?
