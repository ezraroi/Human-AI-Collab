# Section 5 — Temporal Architecture   
This notebook establishes that [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) formation is intrinsically temporal: the felt "click" is not treated as self-validating. A Selected Fact is adopted on probation and confirmed only through in-futuro validation—what it enables, stabilizes, and reorganizes at T+n, not merely what it clarifies at time T.   
The temporal structure of Selected Fact formation in this research has three phases:   
1. **Pre-SF: digestion and incubation ("dark laboring")**
Before a Selected Fact can occur, [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) must become containable and metabolizable through containment, tolerable not-knowing, and [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) engagement—which unfolds across returns. Alpha-function transforms beta-elements into [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md), but these remain scattered (PS position) until SF organizes them. In practice, this phase often presents as repeated engagement with the same fragments without coherent synthesis.   
2. **SF Event: discontinuous coherence ("the click")**
The Selected Fact itself is experienced as a discontinuity: an organizing configuration becomes available and the experiential field reorganizes. This is the phenomenological signature of SF. However, this subjective coherence is treated as a candidate organizing event, not as proof.   
3. **Post-SF: probation and validation at T+n**
After the event, the coherence must survive [time](time.md). The research treats a Selected Fact as valid only if it demonstrates:   
    - **Persistence:** it remains compelling across later returns   
    - **Deepening:** it generates further integration rather than closing inquiry   
    - **Actionability:** it expands what is thinkable and actionable, enabling new [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C)   
    - **Embodied uptake:** it changes how the material is felt and held, not only described   
   
This temporal architecture makes Time constitutive within the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system. Time is not merely incubation "before" insight; it is also the validation medium "after" insight. A single powerful dialogue may generate felt coherence at T, but without probationary testing across T+n it cannot be classified as Selected Fact in the research sense.
