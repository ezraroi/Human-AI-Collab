# Section 2 — Definition   
In this research, [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) (SF) is defined as an **event of organizing coherence**: a discontinuous moment in which previously scattered, contradictory, or unlinked material becomes unified by a single configuration that makes the whole suddenly intelligible and usable. In practice, this material often includes **[alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md) that are already processed but remain unintegrated**.   
SF is therefore **event-type, not content-type**. It is not “a statement” or “an explanation” that can be evaluated only by logical quality; it is the emergence of a unifying organization that transforms the status of the material from unintegrated fragments into coherent psychic and epistemic structure.   
Two features are locked by this notebook:   
1. **SF is metabolically consequential, not rhetorically persuasive.** A Selected Fact is evidenced by a shift in how the material can be held: it changes what is thinkable, bearable, and actionable. This distinguishes SF from fluency, clever linkage, or narrative smoothness.   
2. **SF has a felt signature and recruits embodied uptake.** Although it can later be articulated in language, SF is characterized by an experiential “click”—a felt recognition that coherence has been discovered. This felt coherence is not treated as proof by itself; it is the subjective signature of an organizing event whose validity must be tested over time.   
   
**What SF is not (discriminators)**   
To prevent conceptual drift, this notebook locks explicit discriminators:   
- **Not interpretation:** interpretations may contribute to the conditions for SF, but SF is the organizing coherence that makes interpretation possible, not the interpretation itself.   
- **Not explanation:** a good explanation can exist without reorganizing the underlying material; SF reorganizes the material such that explanation becomes grounded rather than imposed.   
- **Not narrative closure:** the production of a satisfying story can mimic coherence while functioning defensively; SF remains open to probationary validation and is not defined by “feels complete.”   
- **Not verbal fluency (“pretty coherence”):** linguistic elegance is neither necessary nor sufficient; the criterion is integration and downstream change.   
   
This definition is adopted because it directly supports the research’s central attribution claim: the [AI](ai.md) may supply candidate linkages and symbolic structure, but it **cannot integrate** a Selected Fact. SF is defined by **human integration**—an internal reorganization evidenced through embodied uptake and durable capacity shift.
