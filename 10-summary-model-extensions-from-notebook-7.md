# 10. Summary: Model Extensions from Notebook 7   
### 10.1 New Theoretical Components   
1. Pre-reflective/Reflective mapping to Channel 1/Channel 2   
2. Minimal Self/Narrative Self distinction and Journal as interface   
3. Editorial Agency as Destiny Drive activation   
4. Digital Neurophenomenology as framing   
5. Hyperreflexivity Trap as opposite failure mode to PSB   
6. Life as ontological ground (not a return-to phase)   
7. Eidetic structure identification through cross-AI variation   
   
### 10.2 Refined Formulations

|  AI performs "computational epoché" |           User brackets; AI is medium of bracketing practice |
|            Hyperreflexivity as risk |              Reflection as mechanism; ungroundedness as risk |
|         Return to life as technique |                  Life as default ground; reflection as entry |
|         Feedback loop IS the bridge | Feedback loop is what bridge enables; architecture IS bridge |

### 10.3 The Complete Picture   
The Third Intelligence model now has phenomenological grounding that explains:   
- Why the Felt Sense works: It's pre-reflective bodily self-affection (Merleau-Ponty's "I can")   
- What transformation changes: The Narrative Self, while the Minimal Self provides verification   
- How Functional Alterity operates: By externalizing the reflective split   
- Why life experience is non-negotiable: Pre-reflective experience is prerequisite for reflection   
- What the system produces: Editorial agency over the Narrative Self (Destiny Drive activation)   
- How to position the work: Digital Neurophenomenology with pragmatic bridge-building
