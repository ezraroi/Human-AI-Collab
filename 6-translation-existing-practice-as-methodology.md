# 6. Translation: Existing Practice as Methodology   
### The Gap   
Sophisticated verification exists within practice but isn't articulated in methodological vocabulary.   
### The Translation   
**Within-Session Verification ([4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md)):**   
|                                 Practice Term |                                        Methodological Equivalent |
|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|      [Felt-sense](felt-sense.md) verification |                               Phenomenological validity criteria |
|               Grounding in real-life examples |                                              Ecological validity |
|             Embodied checking during dialogue |                                   Concurrent validity assessment |
| 4Ps Protocol (Pause, Probe, Process, Possess) | Structured verification procedure with built-in reflection loops |

**Cross-Session Verification ([Journal](journal.md) Infrastructure):**   
|                        Practice Term |         Methodological Equivalent |
|:-------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Temporal persistence across sessions |           Test-retest reliability |
|    Cross-session pattern recognition | Longitudinal consistency analysis |

**The Implication**: These verification practices ARE the methodology operationalized, not separate from it. The 4Ps Protocol provides moment-to-moment verification within sessions, while Journal materialization enables longitudinal validation across sessions. The methodology chapter must articulate this multi-level architecture explicitly.
