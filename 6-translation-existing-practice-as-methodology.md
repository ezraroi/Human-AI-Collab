# 6. Translation: Existing Practice as Methodology   
### The Gap   
Sophisticated verification exists within practice but isn't articulated in methodological vocabulary.   
### The Translation   
**Within-Session Verification ([4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md)):**

| [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) (RPVL) | Continuous validity monitoring throughout dialogue |
|                                        4Ps Protocol (Pause, Probe, Process, Possess) | Structured acceptance checkpoint at uptake moments |
|                                               Felt-sense verification (Possess step) |                 Phenomenological validity criteria |
|                                       Grounding in real-life examples (Possess step) |                                Ecological validity |
|                                                     Embodied checking (Possess step) |                     Concurrent validity assessment |

**Cross-Session Verification ([Journal](journal.md) Infrastructure):**   
|                        Practice Term |         Methodological Equivalent |

| Temporal persistence across sessions |           Test-retest reliability |
|    Cross-session pattern recognition | Longitudinal consistency analysis |

**The Implication**: These verification practices ARE the methodology operationalized, not separate from it. Within sessions, RPVL provides continuous verification across dialogue while the 4Ps Protocol enforces structured checkpoints at each acceptance moment. Across sessions, Journal materialization enables longitudinal validation. The methodology chapter must articulate this multi-level architecture explicitly.. The methodology chapter must articulate this multi-level architecture explicitly.
