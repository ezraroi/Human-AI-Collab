# 6. The Final Positioning Framework   
Based on the triangulated insights, your research enters the field as:   
- A complement to augmentation literature   
- A completion of identity-risk literature   
- An operationalization of speculative work on AI-mediated identity transformation   
- A correction to architectural assumptions (Dyad → Tetrad)   
- A bridge between psychoanalysis, phenomenology, and HCI   
- A system-level account of psychological development within AI-supported interaction   
   
It fills this precise gap:   
While existing AI–human collaboration research explains how AI amplifies human capacity, no research investigates how **AI-supported interaction**, within a recursive system ([Human](human.md) + [Journal](journal.md) + [AI](ai.md) + [Time](time.md)), can **support the conditions for structural psychological transformation** over time—through durable materialization (Journal), temporal dynamics (Time), and human metabolic processing and authorship (Human), rather than informational transfer alone.   
This is your formal gap statement.
