# 6. The Final Positioning Framework   
Based on the triangulated insights, this research enters the field as:   
- A complement to augmentation literature   
- A completion of identity-risk literature   
- An operationalization of speculative work on AI-mediated identity transformation   
- A correction to architectural assumptions (Dyad → Tetrad)   
- A bridge between psychoanalysis, phenomenology, and HCI   
- A system-level account of psychological development within AI-supported interaction   
   
It fills this precise gap:   
While existing AI–human collaboration research explains how AI amplifies human capacity, no research investigates how AI-supported interaction—within a recursive system ([Human](human.md) + [Journal](journal.md) + [AI](ai.md) + [Time](time.md))—can support the conditions for structural psychological transformation over time through (1) **durable materialization in a persistent chronotope (the Journal)** and (2) **time-delayed re-entry and consolidation (Time)**, while keeping (3) **metabolic processing and authorship in the Human**. This is a different causal story than informational transfer: the Journal is constitutive of continuity and stabilization, not an auxiliary memory aid.   
This is your formal gap statement.
