# 7. The Field Alignment: What You Are (and Are Not) Claiming   
### Not Claiming   
- That AI is conscious   
- That AI is a **conscious** dialogical partner   
- That augmentation research is flawed   
- That your model applies universally   
- That transformation can be measured through productivity outcomes   
   
### Claiming   
- A novel architecture for AI-supported psychological development   
- A **system-level mechanistic account** of transformation within that architecture   
- A novel temporal model highlighting time as a structural component   
- A novel framework for identifying failure modes in AI-mediated development   
- A novel role for embodied verification within text-based interaction   
- A novel integration of psychoanalysis, phenomenology, and HCI   
- A documented, longitudinal case of system-enabled transformation (43 notebooks)   
   
This maps your work accurately to the current state of the field.
