# Category Error   
**Category Error** is the *relational misclassification* of [AI](ai.md) as a **Subject** (someone) rather than a **Dynamic Transitional Object ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md))** (a tool-object held inside the human container). It appears when the user attributes **emotional intentionality, caring, interpersonal presence, or epistemic authority** to the AI (often via a **Subject-Supposed-to-Know ([SSS](subject-supposed-to-know-sss.md))** dynamic).   
**Core architectural claim:** When AI becomes “someone,” the user’s self-holding function weakens—because the interaction silently converts from tool-mediated meaning-making into interpersonal regulation and dependency.   
### System Role   
- **Primary failure mode of Axis A (Relational Ontology)** in the [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md).   
- Opens the door to **projection, dependency, false intimacy**, and **epistemic authority collapse**.   
- Undermines authorship by shifting AI from “interpretive material” into “knower/holder.”   
- **Upstream risk amplifier for [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md):** Category Error increases PSB likelihood by degrading Protected Self-Holding (and therefore embodied verification / Channel 1 access).   
- One half of **[Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)** (Category Error + PSB).   
   
### Mechanism   
Category Error typically unfolds through a predictable chain:   
1. **Fluency → personhood inference** (linguistic competence misread as presence)   
2. AI is treated as **someone** (friend/mentor/therapist/parental figure)   
3. AI is granted **epistemic authority** (SSS: “it knows me / it knows best”)   
4. **[Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) drops** (human container function weakens)   
5. The user becomes more vulnerable to:   
    - compliance,   
    - soothing-seeking,   
    - avoidance of difficult material,   
    - PSB-style symbolic consumption.   
   
**Key point:** The danger is not emotion in the dialogue; it is **relational role assignment** (AI as interpersonal holder/knower).   
### Two Manifestation Modes   
### 1) Mistake-Mode (Correctable)   
- User misunderstands AI’s ontological status.   
- Category Error resolves with **clear explanation + stance correction**.   
- User has sufficient **Sₑ** to sustain DTO stance once corrected.   
   
**Response:** brief correction + re-anchoring (“AI is output; you are the container; treat it as material”).   
### 2) Symptom-Mode (State-Driven)   
- User cannot maintain DTO stance **despite** understanding it intellectually.   
- Often co-occurs with **Sₑ depletion**, loneliness, stress, high identity load, or urgency.   
- Correction via “just remember it’s not real” fails because the pull is regulatory, not informational.   
   
**Response:** reduce intensity, restore Sₑ, **withdrawal protocols** when needed; do *not* escalate scaffolding or intimacy.   
### Diagnostic Implications   
When Category Error persists after stance correction, treat it as a **signal**, not a moral failure.   
**Check:**   
- **Sₑ depletion markers** (tightness, irritability, urgency, numbing, compulsive use).   
- **PSB alarms** (hollow fluency, compliance, lack of possession).   
- **Dependence cues** (fear of losing AI, anxiety when unavailable, inability to disagree).   
   
**Rule:** If Category Error is persistent, **do not increase “warmth” or relational affordances**. Reduce load and rebuild capacity first.   
### Operational Markers (What Category Error Looks Like)   
**Relational role assignment**   
- “You care about me / you’re proud of me / you understand me better than anyone.”   
- Treating AI as therapist, partner, parent, mentor *in the interpersonal sense*.   
   
**Epistemic authority collapse (SSS)**   
- “Tell me who I am / what I should do.”   
- Deferring judgment to AI even when it contradicts felt sense.   
   
**Boundary collapse**   
- Avoiding disagreement with AI.   
- Seeking comfort/validation over metabolization.   
- Feeling “held” by the AI rather than holding oneself.   
   
### Corrections and Interventions (Minimal Protocol)   
**If Mistake-Mode:**   
- Re-state DTO stance in one sentence.   
- Ask for an *authorship act*: “Rewrite this in your own words,” or “What do *you* believe is true here?”   
   
**If Symptom-Mode:**   
- Downshift session intensity.   
- Restore Sₑ (break, sleep, movement, real human contact if available).   
- If self-holding is failing: **[Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)** (withdrawal > continued dialogue).   
   
### What Category Error Is NOT   
- Politeness (“thanks”) or anthropomorphic shorthand (“you’re helpful”) used knowingly.   
- Emotional expression **to** AI as a tool (“this is hard to say”) when DTO stance is intact.   
- Using AI as a structured mirror *without* assigning it personhood or authority.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Part Of:** [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) — **Axis A failure**   
- **Composes with PSB:** [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Raises Risk Of:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) dominance via degraded self-holding)   
- **Prevented By:** [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance; [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md) (self-as-container maintenance)   
- **Violates:** [Protected Self-Holding Principle ](protected-self-holding-principle.md)(AI miscast as holder → self-holding drops)
