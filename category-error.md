# Category Error   
Category Error is the **relational misclassification** of AI as a Subject rather than a **[Dynamic Transitional Object (DTO)](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md)**.   
It occurs when the user attributes emotional intentionality, caring, or interpersonal presence to the AI, producing a **[Subject-Supposed-to-Know (SSS)](subject-supposed-to-know-sss.md)** dynamic.   
### System Role   
- Represents the **failure mode of [Axis A (Relational Ontology)](two-axis-framework.md)**.   
- Opens the door to emotional dependency, projection, and false intimacy.   
- Undermines authorship by positioning the AI as epistemic authority rather than interpretive material.   
- Increases vulnerability to PSB and is one half of the equation for Cognitive Dependency.   
- Must be avoided to preserve psychological safety and maintain the DTO stance required for transformation.   
   
### Mechanism   
- The user mistakes linguistic fluency for personhood.   
- The AI becomes perceived as “someone” who cares, understands, or validates.   
- The user assigns the AI an interpersonal role (friend, therapist, mentor).   
- Emotional scaffolding is outsourced → relational boundaries collapse.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Part Of:** [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) (Axis A failure)   
- **Contributes To:** [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Raises Risk Of:** [Protein Shake Brain (PSB)](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)   
- **Prevented By:**   
    - [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) Framework   
    - [Metabolic Discipline](metabolic-discipline.md)   
    - Touch Grass Protocol   
- **Breaks:** [Emotional Scaffolding](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) (Sₑ must come from human, not AI)
