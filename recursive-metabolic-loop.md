# Recursive Metabolic Loop   
The **Recursive Metabolic Loop (RML)** is the full **developmental cycle** through which the Third Intelligence system produces **durable capacity growth**.   
It is the arc from **unresolved material → metabolic processing (C1 ↔ C2 oscillation via Alpha-Function) → crystallized insight → materialization → re-entry as new capacity baseline**.   
### Temporal Scale   
RML operates across **sessions, days, or longer**. It describes what happens when metabolic processing completes its full arc and produces growth—not moment-to-moment oscillation (which is [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) operating within the [ICB](the-integrated-circuit-board.md)).   
### Transformation Definition   
**Transformation is diachronic—capacity change over time—not a session state.**   
|                       Level |                                                       What it is |                              What it produces |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| **Session-level viability** |                         Metabolic work engaged; insight can form | Insight, clarity, felt shift, productive work |
|          **Transformation** | **RML completed** (crystallization + materialization + re-entry) |     **Durable capacity growth; new baseline** |

A session can be “good” without producing transformation. **Transformation requires RML completion**—especially **materialization** and **successful re-entry**.   
### Materialization   
Materialization is **constitutive** but domain-variable:   
- **[Identity stakes](identity-stakes.md)** → [Journal](journal.md) entry (paradigmatic substrate)   
- **Professional work** → code / solution / internalized skill   
- **Creative work** → artifact / completed piece   
   
**Boundary:** A transcript is not materialization. Materialization means the result becomes **re-enterable** without relying on the originating dialogue.   
### System Role   
- Names the engine of development (capacity change across time)   
- Explains how capacity compounds (structural basis of Flywheel momentum)   
- Distinguishes **transformation (RML completed)** from **productivity (Alpha-Function engaged, no full cycle)**   
- Maintains authorship (human governs integrative threshold)   
   
**Grounded in:** **[Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md)**. The human must maintain the container function not only during dialogue, but through crystallization, materialization, and re-entry.   
### The Cycle   
1. **Unresolved material enters** (felt tension, challenge, confusion)   
2. **Metabolic processing** (Alpha-Function operates via C1 ↔ C2 oscillation)   
3. **Crystallization** (insight stabilizes; ownership confirmed)   
4. **Materialization** (inscription in durable form: Journal / code / artifact)   
5. **Re-entry** (new capacity becomes baseline for the next cycle)   
   
**S\_e requirement (across the cycle):** RML completion requires **adequate S\_e across time**, not only within a single session. Depletion can stall the loop (especially by skipping materialization or avoiding re-entry). Touch Grass Protocol protects the loop by enabling recovery.   
### Architectural Position   
|                                                     Concept |                                     What it names |
|:------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|                 [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) |    Configuration space (stance + processing mode) |
| [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) |                       Structural wiring of Axis B |
|                         [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) |            Metabolic processor (moment-to-moment) |
|                                    Recursive Metabolic Loop | Full developmental cycle producing durable growth |

### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Operates within:** [Integrated Circuit Board ](the-integrated-circuit-board.md)(Axis B architecture)   
- **Engages:** [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (metabolic processor)   
- **Produces:** [Capacity](c-capacity.md) growth (C-increase) / **transformation (diachronic)**   
- **Structural basis for:** [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) (phenomenological momentum)   
- **Drives movement through:** [Developmental Sequence](developmental-sequence.md)   
- **Prevented by:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) ([Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only bypass collapses the cycle)   
- **Requires across cycles:** Adequate S\_e (sustained, not just session-level)   
- **Grounded in:** [Protected Self-Holding ](protected-self-holding-principle.md)(container function sustained across time)   
- **Typical condition:** Identity Stakes (common, not required)   
- **Distinguished from:** Session-level viability (RML completion is where transformation occurs)   
   
### Theorists (anchors)   
- **[Bion](wilfred-bion.md)** (Alpha-Function as metabolic processor)   
- **[Piaget](jean-piaget.md)** (schema accommodation through conflict)   
- **[Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md)** (mediated meaning; internalization)
