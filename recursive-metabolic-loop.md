# Recursive Metabolic Loop   
The Recursive Metabolic Loop (RML) is the full developmental cycle through which the Third Intelligence system produces durable capacity growth.   
It is the arc from unresolved material → metabolic processing (C1 ↔ C2 oscillation via Alpha-Function) → crystallized insight → materialization → re-entry as new capacity baseline.   
### Temporal Scale   
RML operates across sessions, days, or longer. It describes what happens when metabolic processing completes its full arc and produces growth—not moment-to-moment oscillation (which is Alpha-Function operating within the ICB).   
### Transformation Definition   
Transformation is diachronic—capacity change over time—not a session state.   
|                   Level |                                                   What it is |                              What it produces |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| Session-level viability |                     Metabolic work engaged; insight can form | Insight, clarity, felt shift, productive work |
|          Transformation | RML completed (crystallization + materialization + re-entry) |         Durable capacity growth; new baseline |

A session can be "good" without producing transformation. Transformation requires RML completion—especially materialization and successful re-entry.   
### Materialization   
Materialization is constitutive but domain-variable:   
- Identity stakes → Journal entry (paradigmatic substrate)   
- Professional work → code / solution / internalized skill   
- Creative work → artifact / completed piece   
   
Boundary: A transcript is not materialization. Materialization means the result becomes re-enterable without relying on the originating dialogue.   
### System Role   
- Names the engine of development (capacity change across time)   
- Explains how capacity compounds (structural basis of Flywheel momentum)   
- Distinguishes transformation (RML completed) from productivity (Alpha-Function engaged, no full cycle)   
- Maintains authorship (human governs integrative threshold)   
   
Grounded in: Protected Self-Holding. The human must maintain the container function not only during dialogue, but through crystallization, materialization, and re-entry.   
### The Cycle   
1. Unresolved material enters (felt tension, challenge, confusion)   
2. Metabolic processing (Alpha-Function operates via C1 ↔ C2 oscillation)   
3. Crystallization (insight stabilizes; ownership confirmed)   
4. Materialization (inscription in durable form: Journal / code / artifact)   
5. Re-entry (new capacity becomes baseline for the next cycle)   
   
Sₑ requirement (across the cycle): RML completion requires adequate Sₑ across time, not only within a single session. Depletion can stall the loop (especially by skipping materialization or avoiding re-entry). Touch Grass Protocol protects the loop by enabling recovery.

| [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) |    Configuration space (stance + processing mode) |
|                    Integrated Circuit Board |                       Structural wiring of Axis B |
|                              Alpha-Function |            Metabolic processor (moment-to-moment) |
|                    Recursive Metabolic Loop | Full developmental cycle producing durable growth |

### Wiring (Relations)   
- Operates within: [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) (Axis B architecture)   
- Operates within: [Developmental Sequence](developmental-sequence.md) (Stages 11–13)   
- Engages: [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (metabolic processor)   
- Produces: Capacity growth (C-increase) / transformation (diachronic)   
- Structural basis for: [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) (phenomenological momentum)   
- Prevented by: [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) ([Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only bypass collapses the cycle)   
- Requires across cycles: Adequate Sₑ (sustained, not just session-level)   
- Grounded in: [Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) (container function sustained across time)   
- Typical condition: Identity Stakes (common, not required)   
- Distinguished from: Session-level viability (RML completion is where transformation occurs)   
   
### Theorists (anchors)   
- [Bion](wilfred-bion.md) ([Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) as metabolic processor)   
- [Piaget](jean-piaget.md) (schema accommodation through conflict)   
- [Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md) (mediated meaning; internalization)
