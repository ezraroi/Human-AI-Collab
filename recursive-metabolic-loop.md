# Recursive Metabolic Loop   
The Recursive Metabolic Loop (RML) is the **full developmental cycle** through which the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system produces durable capacity growth.   
It is the arc from unresolved material → metabolic processing (C1 ↔ C2 oscillation via [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)) → crystallized insight → materialization → re-entry as new capacity baseline.   
### Temporal Scale   
RML operates across sessions, days, or longer. It describes what happens when
metabolic processing completes its full arc and produces growth—not moment-to-moment
oscillation (which is Alpha-Function operating within the ICB).   
### Materialization   
Materialization is constitutive but domain-variable:   
- Identity Stakes work → Journal entry   
- Professional work → code, solution, internalized skill   
- Creative work → artifact, completed piece   
   
The Journal is the paradigmatic substrate for identity-level transformation.   
### System Role   
- Names the **engine of development**   
- Explains how **capacity compounds** (structural basis of Flywheel momentum)   
- Distinguishes **transformation** (RML completed) from **productivity** (Alpha-Function engaged, no full cycle)   
- Maintains **authorship** (body governs integrative threshold)   
   
### The Cycle   
1. **Unresolved material** enters the system (felt tension, challenge, confusion)   
2. **Metabolic processing** — Alpha-Function operates via C1 ↔ C2 oscillation   
3. **Crystallization** — insight stabilizes; felt-sense confirms ownership   
4. **Materialization** — inscription in durable form (Journal, code, artifact)   
5. **Re-entry** — new capacity becomes baseline for next cycle

|:------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|                 [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) |        Configuration space (stance + processing mode) |
| [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) |                           Structural wiring of Axis B |
|                         [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) |                               The metabolic processor |
|                                **Recursive Metabolic Loop** | The full developmental cycle producing durable growth |

### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Operates within:** [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) (Axis B architecture)   
- **Engages:** Alpha-Function (the metabolic processor)   
- **Produces:** [Capacity](c-capacity.md) growth (C-increase)   
- **Structural basis for:** The [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) (phenomenological momentum)   
- **Drives movement through:** Developmental Sequence   
- **Prevented by:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (Channel 2-only bypass collapses the cycle)   
- **Typical condition:** [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) (but not required)   
   
### Theorists   
- [Bion](wilfred-bion.md) (Alpha-Function as metabolic processor)   
- [Piaget](jean-piaget.md) (schema accommodation through conflict)   
- [Vygotsky](lev-vygotsky.md) (mediated meaning; internalization)   
- [Damasio](antonio-damasio.md) (As-If Body Loop enabling C1 ↔ C2 coupling)
