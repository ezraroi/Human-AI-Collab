# ABA Design (Withdrawal Phase)   
The methodological reframing of "Touch Grass" or "Withdrawal" periods. It functions as a natural experiment to test causal attribution.   
**The Phases:**   
- **Phase A (Intervention):** High-intensity AI dialogue.   
- **Phase B (Withdrawal):** Total cessation of AI interaction.   
   
**The Test:**
If transformation persists during **Phase B**, it proves that  has been structurally internalized and is not just a fleeting mood boost dependent on the AI's presence.
*Note: The  persists during Phase B, proving it is the "[Surviving Object](surviving-object.md)"*.
