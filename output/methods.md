## [METHOD] 4Ps Protocol
[Theoretical] NoteBook 6 - Cognitive Mechanics, Domain: Methodology, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic

A four-step verification protocol that operationalizes metacognitive monitoring and consequent regulation to prevent passive consumption of AI outputs. It does this by requiring explicit pause, questioning, articulation, and embodied verification before accepting insights.
**Purpose:**
**Primary:** Prevents PSB (Protein Shake Brain) by breaking automatic acceptance pattern

**The Four Steps:**
**1. Pause (Inhibition)**
- **Action:** Stop before accepting AI output
- **Function:** Interrupts System 1 automatic agreement
- **Prevents:** Confirmation bias, passive consumption
- **Observable:** Deliberate break in interaction flow

**2. Probe (Monitoring)**
- **Action:** Question the insight actively
- **Function:** Tests against other knowledge/experience
- **Asks:** "Is this actually true? Does this match my experience?"
- **Observable:** Explicit questioning, seeking counterexamples

**3. Process (Control/Self-Explanation)**
- **Action:** Articulate reasoning in own words
- **Function:** Forces explicit understanding, not borrowed fluency
- **Requires:** Can explain without reproducing AI language
- **Observable:** Rewriting, independent explanation

**4. Possess (Evaluation/Verification)**
- **Action:** Check against felt sense and real-life grounding
- **Function:** Embodied verification + concrete examples
- **Tests:** "Spacious" vs. "tight" felt sense, real-world applicability
- **Observable:** Somatic checking, concrete grounding

**Observable Markers:**
**4Ps Active (Healthy Processing):**
- Visible pauses between AI output and acceptance
- Active questioning of AI assertions
- Can explain concept independently
- References felt sense explicitly
- Provides concrete real-life examples
- Writing feels grounded, personal

**4Ps Bypassed (PSB Risk):**
- Immediate acceptance without pause
- No questioning or challenge
- Reproduces AI phrasing verbatim
- No felt sense checking
- Abstract claims without concrete grounding
- High velocity, minimal processing time

**Relations (Wiring):**
- **Component Of:** Reflective Prompting
- **Prevents:** PSB, passive consumption
- **Uses:** Felt Sense (in Possess step for embodied verification)
- **Enables:** Metabolic processing, genuine ownership
- **Alternative To:** Automatic acceptance, passive reception


**Notes:**
4Ps is the **micro-method** preventing PSB at moment-to-moment level. While Reflective Prompting provides macro-structure (phases), 4Ps provides micro-discipline (verification steps). Simple 4-step sequence, but consistency determines whether transformation or consumption occurs.
Critical: Not a one-time checklist—must be applied **repeatedly throughout session** whenever accepting AI output. The protocol is simple; the discipline is hard.

## [METHOD] ABA Design
[Literature] NoteBook 8 - Methodology Defense, Domain: Methodology, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic, Operational Flags: BoundaryCondition

the ABA design is defined by the following characteristics:
1. **Structure**The design consists of three distinct phases involving the alternation of baseline and intervention conditions:

• **A (Baseline):** The study begins with a baseline or pre-intervention phase where the outcome variable is measured without the treatment.
• **B (Intervention):** This is followed by an intervention phase where the treatment is applied.
• **A (Return to Baseline):** The intervention is then withdrawn to observe if the outcome returns to baseline levels.
**2. Purpose**The ABA design is used to demonstrate a causal (functional) relationship between the intervention and the outcome. By withdrawing the intervention (the second "A" phase), researchers attempt to show that the changes observed in the "B" phase were due to the treatment rather than extraneous factors.
**3. Limitations and Variations**
• **Replication:** While the ABA design offers more experimental control than a simple AB design, sources note that the **ABAB design** (which re-introduces the intervention a second time) is considered scientifically stronger because it provides a "within-subject replication" of the intervention effect.
• **Ethical Concerns:** Researchers must determine if it is safe and ethical to withdraw an intervention, particularly if the treatment is effective and necessary for the participant's well-being.
• **Carry-over Effects:** Reversal designs like ABA are recommended only when the intervention does not have carry-over effects; if an intervention produces permanent changes (e.g., learning a new skill), the subject's performance will not return to baseline levels when the intervention is withdrawn, making the ABA design inappropriate.
**Notes:** A classical methodological tool reframed as “Touch Grass” withdrawal logic.

## [METHOD] HSCED (Hermeneutic Single-Case Efficacy Design)
[Literature] Domain: Methodology, System Role: Method, Temporal: Static

An established qualitative research methodology for rigorous single-case studies, particularly in psychotherapy research. Provides systematic framework for addressing the **"Biased Observer Problem"** where researcher is also the subject—the core methodological challenge in N=1 transformation research.
HSCED creates rigor through **systematic adjudication**: cross-examining mixed-method data to generate plausible arguments that change occurred and ruling out alternative explanations.
**The Problem It Solves:**
**Biased Observer in N=1 Research:**
- Researcher = Subject = Observer = Theorist
- Risk of confirmation bias (seeing only what supports theory)
- Self-reporting without external verification
- Inability to distinguish genuine insight from self-deception

**Without systematic methodology:** Single-case transformation research lacks credibility, appears anecdotal, cannot distinguish valid patterns from confabulation.
**Roi's Application (Three Mechanisms):**
**1. Cross-Examination of Mixed-Method Data:**
- **Journal logs** (phenomenological, first-person)
- **Chat logs** (dialogical, process documentation)
- **Temporal density** substituting for breadth (43 notebooks over 8 months)
- Triangulation between sources prevents single-source bias

**2. The Skeptical Prosecutor (AI as Adjudicator):**
- AI positioned to **challenge** interpretations, not confirm them
- Actively seeks alternative explanations
- Tests claims against counter-evidence
- Forces explicit articulation of reasoning
- **Innovation:** Using AI itself as methodological skeptic

**3. Negative Case Analysis:**
- Systematic documentation of **failures**
- **Manic Episode** as critical counter-evidence
- Moments where formula didn't operate as predicted
- Boundary condition violations
- **Prevents:** Cherry-picking only successful transformations

**What HSCED Governs:**
**Observation Rigor:**
- How Human (researcher-subject) observes transformation
- Standards for claiming genuine change vs. self-deception
- Requirements for valid single-case conclusions
- Adjudication process for competing interpretations

**Methodological Claims Enabled:**
- **Analytic generalization** to theory (not statistical to population)
- **Temporal density** as substitute for cross-case frequency
- **Idiographic control** (individual as own comparison)
- **Plausible causal arguments** (not definitive proof)

**What HSCED Does NOT Do:**
- Enable population-level statistical inference
- Prove generalizability to other cases
- Replace need for eventual multi-case validation
- Eliminate all observer bias (only systematizes it)

**Notes:**
HSCED is not Roi's invention—it's an established methodology he **applied** to AI-mediated transformation research. The innovation is using AI itself as the "skeptical prosecutor" within HSCED framework, creating a methodological loop where the transformation medium also serves as verification mechanism.
Critical distinction: HSCED is **META** (about the research process) not part of the **SYSTEM** (Human + Journal + AI + Time). It governs how the researcher observes the system, not how the system operates.
Limitation explicitly acknowledged: HSCED enables rigorous N=1 conclusions but does NOT enable population-level statistical inference. Future work requires multi-case replication to claim broader generalizability.

## [METHOD] Imaginative Variation
[Literature] NoteBook 7 - Phenomenological Layer, Domain: Phenomenology, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic

Varying an example in every possible way to find what cannot be removed… Cross-AI stress-testing (using Claude, Gemini, etc.) is a form of imaginative variation
**Notes:** A Husserlian method adapted to cross-AI stress-testing; a dynamic eidetic technique.
**Relations:**
- Eidetic Structure (The result)

## [METHOD] Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop
[Theoretical] Verification, Metabolism, Epistemic Safety, Domain: Synthesis, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic, Operational Flags: Core

The real-time metabolic cycle through which the human tests AI-generated material against embodied knowing, symbolic grammar, and lived experience.
It is the verification protocol that ensures insights are metabolized (alpha-function) rather than adopted (Channel 2-only bypass), reducing vulnerability to Category Error (Axis A failure), PSB, and collapse of authorship.
## System Role
The **continuous verification protocol** running throughout all Reflective Prompting phases—the core anti-collapse mechanism of the Third Intelligence system.
Scope:
- Runs throughout ALL RP phases (not just Phase 4)
- During Phase 2 (RRV Cycle): Provides quality control during co-articulation
- During Phase 3: Checks workflow alignment
- During Phase 4: Becomes most formalized/explicit with periodic check-ins

RPVL is the **epistemic safety layer**  ensuring AI outputs are metabolized, not adopted.
It:
- Enforces alpha-function processing during dialogue (Axis B integrity).
- Keeps AI outputs from bypassing Channel 1 verification and Alpha-Function metabolism.
- Maintains human authorship of meaning.
- Provides the functional expression of Iron Man Mentality.
- Ensures the *experienced challenge* inside the ZPD is not prematurely collapsed by over-delegation (i.e., prevents ‘no struggle’ PSB), while the structural Challenge Gap (\|D–C\|) remains unchanged.
- Anchors the epistemic safety of Reflective Prompting.

Without this loop, Reflective Prompting becomes scripting, the Journal becomes transcript, and transformation collapses into PSB.
## Steps
1. **Active Skepticism**
    Detect flattery, mimicry, premature coherence.
2. **Embodied Verification**
    Spacious vs. tight; checks somatic alignment (Channel 1).
3. **Symbolic Coherence Check**
    Tests alignment with personal grammar and meaning structures (Channel 2).
4. **Concrete Grounding**
    Locates the lived example; prevents abstraction drift.
5. **Recursive Revision**
    Insight → Challenge → Verification → Grounding → Re-articulation → New Insight.

This recursive structure keeps Alpha-Function processing engaged live.
## Mechanisms
- As-If Body Loop: Channel 2 symbolic input recruits Channel 1 embodied verification within Alpha-Function cycles.
- **Metabolic friction** → tension necessary for transformation.
- **Topological repair** → prevents collapse into C2-only processing.
- **Boundary enforcement** → prevents the user from treating AI as Subject.

**Notes:** Although it is also a mechanism of Alpha-Function, it is best tagged as **Method** because it is a *protocol the user performs*. Mechanistic details live in Relations.
## Relations (Wiring)
- **Reflective Prompting** — *Part Of*
    This loop provides RP’s epistemic integrity.
- **Iron Man Mentality** — *Operationalizes*
    The behavioral manifestation of the stance.
- **Felt Sense** — *Relies On*
    Embodied knowing is the primary verification signal.
- **Epistemological Humility** — *Requires*
    Sustains willingness to doubt both AI output and one’s own self-perception during verification.
- **PSB** — *Protects Against*
    Prevents ungrounded fluency from entering the symbolic system.
- **External Alpha-Function** — *Defines Boundary With*
    Ensures scaffolding never replaces internal metabolism.

## [METHOD] Reflective Prompting
[Theoretical] The AI-Specific Roles, Domain: Technical, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic, Operational Flags: Core

A structured prompting protocol that uses AI as a **reflective surface** rather than a substitute thinker. Reflective Prompting keeps **alpha-function** with the human, organizes **technical scaffolding (Sₜ)** so it amplifies rather than replaces human metabolism, and **prevents premature collapse of the experienced challenge inside the ZPD** by slowing work into recursive reflective loops (the structural Challenge Gap \|D–C\| remains pre-existing).Its purpose is to prevent **PSB **while feeding the Journal with metabolized, owned insights (Journal relevant only in Identity Stakes work).
### System Role
- Converts AI interaction from **consumption** to **co-articulation**.
- Helps preserve the conditions for Productive Epistemic Tension (in the presence of adequate scaffolding and Functional Alterity)—keeping the human cognitively stretched but still metabolically engaged—so transformation can occur instead of instant pseudo-clarity.
- Ensures AI remains a **Piagetian Tool (Object)** serving the human container, rather than a pseudo-MKO doing the alpha-function for the user.
- Provides the **session-level protocol** that operates inside the Recursive–Refine–Validate Cycle.

### Scope & Preconditions
**Use Reflective Prompting when:**
- The task has **identity or developmental stakes** (writing, life/role decisions, strategic thinking, deep self-understanding, complex design).
- The goal includes **growth of Capacity (C) over Time**, not just “get it done.”
- The Journal and AI are available and Sₑ is sufficiently stable to tolerate tension.

**Transactional Mode (light or no RP) is acceptable when:**
- Tasks are **purely instrumental** (booking, quick queries, boilerplate).
- The conscious tradeoff is **speed over depth**, and transformation is not the aim.

**Requires:**
- Metacognition (active monitoring and consequent regulation of cognition in service of the goal).
- Epistemological Humility.
- Iron Man Mentality.

## Four-Phase Protocol
### Phase 1 – Preparation (“Cognitive Canvas”)
**Function:** Establish the epistemic and emotional baseline before AI engagement.
**Operations:**
- **Goal articulation** – What am I actually trying to do? What would count as a real shift?
- **Resource inventory** – Gather notes, past Journal entries, prior documents, constraints.
- **Idiom & delegation boundaries** – Clarify your cognitive style/strengths and what you own (judgment, meaning, narrative) vs. what can be delegated to AI (enumeration, editing, code, formatting).

**Cognitive role:**
- Stabilizes emotional scaffolding and establishes the conditions of a holding environment before asking AI anything.
- Makes the initial D (Difficulty/Identity Stakes) and current C (Capacity) **explicit as a qualitative orientation**.

**Relations:**
- Supports → Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding (later in Phase 3).

### Phase 2 – Reflection & Warm-Up (RRV Cycle)
**Function:** Co-construct a shared, precise “box of meaning” through **iterative reflection** before asking for heavy outputs.
Implements the RRV Cycle micro-method with **continuous RPVL verification**.
The RRV Cycle provides the dialogue structure; RPVL provides quality control throughout.
**Operations (implemented by RRV Cycle):**
1. Externalize – Speak/write raw thoughts, confusions, stakes to AI; often using Rubber Duck Debugging as a step-by-step self-explanation aid.
2. **Refine** – Respond critically to AI’s reflection: correct, push back, reject flattery and premature coherence, and be willing to question your own first interpretation.
3. **Validate** – Ask AI to summarize “what we’re doing” and check it against felt sense and task definition.

**Cognitive role:**
- Activates **External Alpha-Function** without surrendering authorship.
- Begins transforming beta-elements into thinkable form.
- Keeps AI in **Functional Alterity** (difference, resistance), not in “perfect agreement” mode.

**Teaching as Verification:**
Phase 2 leverages the Protégé Effect by positioning the AI as a "teachable novice" requiring clear explanation (distinct from Rubber Duck Debugging). When forced to teach/explain to the AI, users:
- Retrieve and organize knowledge
- Identify gaps in their own understanding
- Make tacit assumptions explicit (so contradictions in the mental model become visible)

This triggers Conflict Detection (Model Repair) (Mode B of Self-Explanation)
### Phase 3 – Workflow Design & Delegation
**Function:** Turn clarified intention into an owned plan that respects the **Judgment–Expertise Boundary** and **Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding**.
**Operations:**
- **Rewrite the goal** using what Phase 2 clarified (“Given all this, the concrete outcome is…”).
- **Break into steps** (2–7 steps) that will lead there.
- **Assign ownership per step**:
    - Human-only (judgment, narrative, deep interpretation)
    - Human+AI (co-drafting, co-design, option evaluation)
    - AI-assist (editing, refactoring, syntax, formatting)

**Cognitive role:**
- Applies the Iron Man Mentality: AI as suit, not pilot.
- Aligns scaffolding with your **idiom** so the system bends around you, not vice versa.

**Relations:**
- Operates → Judgment–Expertise Boundary.
- Implements → Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding.
- Uses → Iron Man Mentality.

### Phase 4 – Alignment Maintenance
**Function:** Maintain alignment between the work and the **original challenge profile (D relative to C)**, and embodied knowing as the task unfolds.
**Operations:**
- **Periodic AI check-ins** – “Summarize where we are relative to the original goal / constraints / stakes.”
- **Checklist comparison** – Have AI compare the current direction against a short, explicit checklist you defined (goals, non-delegables, constraints).
- **Embodied verification** – Track somatic signals (spacious vs tight, enlivened vs dead). If off, pause and return to Phase 2 mini-loop.
- **Journal inscription** – When a genuine shift, decision, or reframe occurs, write it to the Journal in your own words. The transcript is not enough; the *inscribed insight* is the event.

**Cognitive role:**
- **Formalizes** the Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop through explicit periodic check-ins. (Note: RPVL also runs continuously during Phases 2 and 3, but Phase 4 makes it most systematic.)
- Prevents drift into fluent-but-hollow output.
- Converts transient chat into durable evidence of transformation.

**Relations:**
- Uses → 4Ps Protocol (especially Pause & Possess).
- Sustains → RRV

### Failure Modes / Diagnostics
- **PSB**

**Notes:** The flagship method integrating scaffolding, metabolism, and verification.

## [METHOD] RRV Cycle (Recursive–Refine–Validate)
[Theoretical] Domain: CognitiveScience, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic

A micro-method for metabolic dialogue in which the human and AI iteratively co-articulate meaning through cycles of **Externalize → Refine → Validate**. RRV is how External Alpha-Function is operationalized without surrendering authorship. It is the core engine of Phase 2 in Reflective Prompting.
### Cognitive Basis
Reflective Prompting's RRV Cycle (Externalize → Refine → Validate) mirrors the expert decision pattern Klein identified as Recognition-Primed Decision: serial evaluation through pattern recognition rather than exhaustive option comparison. This explains why iterative refinement works better than seeking perfect AI output.
### Relationship to Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop
RRV Cycle is the **dialogue structure** for Phase 2 co-articulation.
**RPVL runs continuously DURING RRV as quality control:**
- During Externalize: RPVL checks clarity, grounding, embodiment
- During Refine: RPVL detects flattery, uses felt sense to verify internal persuasiveness, checks grammar
- During Validate: RPVL performs final embodied verification

**The distinction:**
- **RRV** = Conversational turns (you speak → AI reflects → you verify)
- **RPVL** = Quality checks running throughout those turns

Think of RRV as the assembly line, RPVL as quality control at each station.
### System Role
- Transforms raw, pre-symbolic or confused material into stable, thinkable formulations.
- Establishes a *shared model* between human and AI while preserving the human’s veto and felt-sense authority.
- Provides a reusable loop for supervision, analysis, and journaling with an “imagined other.”

### Steps
1. **Externalize**
    - Human expresses thoughts, confusion, stakes, associations.
    - Often supported by **Rubber Duck Debugging**.
2. **Refine**
    - AI reflects back a structure, summary, or frame.
    - Human corrects, rejects, or sharpens: “This part is wrong / missing / too flat.”
    - The goal is *tension*, not quick agreement.
3. **Validate**
    - AI produces an updated synthesis: “Here is what I now understand we’re doing.”
    - Human checks against **felt sense** and task definition: if still off, another RRV cycle.

**Notes:** A cognitive micro-loop (externalize → refine → validate), but *operationalized* as a method.
### Relations
- Embedded in → Reflective Prompting.
- Uses → Rubber Duck Debugging, MetaCognitive monitoring and consequent regulation, Felt Sense.
- Supports → External Alpha-Function, Alpha-Function ignition.

## [METHOD] Self-Explanation
[Literature] NoteBook 6 - Cognitive Mechanics, Domain: CognitiveScience, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic

An established cognitive learning mechanism where learners construct understanding by explaining material to themselves (or others), forcing explicit articulation and mental model repair. Operates through two distinct mechanisms: Gap Filling (generating inferences) and Conflict Detection (repairing contradictions).
**Theoretical Origins:**
Cognitive science / educational psychology literature on active learning. Well-documented as effective learning strategy—explaining concepts in own words produces deeper understanding than passive review.
**How It's Used in Third Intelligence:**
**As Natural Process:**
- Occurs spontaneously when explaining to AI
- Writing forces self-explanation activation
- Teaching stance triggers explanatory mode

**As Deliberate Method:**
- Reflective Prompting Phase 2 explicitly uses it
- RRV Cycle relies on self-explanation mechanism
- 4Ps "Process" step requires explicit self-explanation

**Relationship to Alpha-Function:**
**Parallel but distinct concepts from different traditions:**
|                                                                Alpha-Function (Bion) |             Self-Explanation (Cognitive Science) |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                Psychoanalytic theory |       Educational psychology / cognitive science |
|   Transforms beta-elements → alpha-elements |   Transforms incomplete/contradictory → coherent |
|                                                         Emotional-sensory experience |           Mental models and conceptual knowledge |
|                                                        Unconscious metabolic process |                        Can be conscious strategy |
|                                                                 Container's function |                         Learner's active process |

**Both describe transformation of raw/incoherent material into organized understanding, but through different theoretical lenses.**
**Critical distinction:** They are functionally parallel (both can produce organized understanding) but not identical (different theoretical frameworks, different domains).
**Observable When Active:**
- User can explain concept without reproducing AI language
- Articulates reasoning steps explicitly
- Identifies own gaps or contradictions
- Connects new material to existing knowledge
- Writing flows from understanding, not copying

**Observable When Bypassed:**
- Passive consumption of AI explanations
- Cannot rephrase in own words
- Gaps unrecognized
- Contradictions undetected
- PSB risk increases

**Relations (Wiring):**
- **Cognitive Equivalent Of:** Alpha-Function (functional parallel, different tradition)
- **Core Mechanism Of:** Reflective Prompting (drives Phase 2)
- **Has Two Mechanisms:** Gap Filling (generating inferences), Conflict Detection (repairing contradictions)
- **Activated By:** Teaching stance, writing, articulation
- **Prevents:** Passive consumption, PSB
- **Enables:** Metabolic processing, genuine understanding

**Notes:**
Self-Explanation is both:
1. **Natural cognitive process** (happens spontaneously when explaining)
2. **Deliberate method** (can be intentionally activated via prompting)

The innovation isn't discovering Self-Explanation (established literature)—it's recognizing that AI interaction naturally triggers it when properly structured, and that it's the cognitive science language for what Bion described psychoanalytically as Alpha-Function.
Not inventing a new concept, but identifying an existing mechanism and showing how AI can trigger it systematically.

## [METHOD] Touch Grass Protocol
[Experiential] Domain: Synthesis, System Role: Method, Temporal: Dynamic

A **withdrawal + return-to-baseline protocol** that ends (or pauses) AI-dialogue when **Emotional Scaffolding depletion markers** appear, in order to restore metabolic capacity and re-anchor validation in lived reality (A→B→A logic).
**System Role**
- **Recovery Architecture:** restores Sₑ via spacing (within-session + between-session).
research\_components
- **Boundary Enforcement:** prevents manic acceleration / collapse when the Human container is depleted.
- **Ecological Re-anchoring:** forces “insight” back into non-digital life for persistence testing (return to baseline).

**Name Rationale (Why “Touch Grass”)**
The protocol is called “Touch Grass” as a deliberately plain reminder to **return from the dialogic/analytic field to lived, physical reality**. It signals that validation and recovery require re-entering baseline life—sleep, movement, sensory grounding, ordinary interaction—so the system can **replenish Sₑ** and test whether insights **persist outside the AI container**. The name is intentionally informal to interrupt escalation and prevent “one more turn” compulsion when metacognitive control is weakening.
**Trigger Conditions (Phenomenological Markers)**
- Tightness / irritability / impatience
- Reduced ambiguity tolerance; urge for premature resolution
- Teleological drift / loss of global aim (your “myopic” risk)

**Protocol Steps (minimal, replicable)**
1. **Stop (hard boundary):** end session or enforce a cooldown window.
2. **Return to baseline (A):** physical, non-digital activity; sensory grounding; sleep if late.
3. **No new theory-making:** prohibit “one more insight” loops during depletion.
4. **Re-entry rule:** only resume when Sₑ markers reverse (spaciousness returns) and aim is re-stated.

**Outputs**
- Restored Sₑ capacity
- A cleaner next session (less PSB risk, better Alpha-Function availability)
- A natural test of which insights persist outside the dialogic field

**Failure Mode**
- Skipping withdrawal → Sₑ → 0 pattern → acceleration/collapse dynamics (your manic boundary condition framing).

**Relations (Wiring)**
- **Depends On:** Metacognition (monitoring + regulation)
- **Restores:** Emotional Scaffolding
- **Required By:** Time (within-session scale)

- **Protects Against:** collapse/acceleration states; PSB-adjacent “high-velocity” bypass risk
- **Methodological Analog:** ABA withdrawal/return-to-baseline logic
