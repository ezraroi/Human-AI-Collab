## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, Temporal: Static

The hub of the Salience Network. It is central to Interoception and Prediction Error detection. A "tight/spacious" felt signal can function as an interoceptive discriminator during embodied verification.
The Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC), often referred to as the anterior insula (AI), is a critical brain structure folded deep within the lateral sulcus of each cerebral hemisphere. Functionally, the AIC is recognized as a component of the **Salience Network (SN)**, where it often works alongside the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Within this framework, the AIC acts as a **fast-acting flexible hub** that detects internal and external stimuli deemed biologically or cognitively relevant. It plays a role in dynamically switching the brain's focus between internal, self-referential processes (like the Default Mode Network) and external, cognitively demanding processes (like the Central Executive Network).
The primary and most critical role of the AIC is in **interoceptive attention**, which is the capacity of the nervous system to sense, interpret, and integrate physiological signals arising from the internal body. Anatomical evidence confirms the AIC is essential for encoding and representing this interoceptive information. The AIC integrates raw sensory input, often received hierarchically from the posterior insula, with emotional salience and cognitive information from areas like the prefrontal cortex. This integration is what creates **subjective and conscious awareness** of the body's internal condition and feelings. Studies involving patients with focal AIC lesions provide causal evidence that the AIC is necessary for accurate interoceptive discrimination and sensitivity.
Beyond internal awareness, the AIC is heavily implicated in high-level cognitive processes, particularly in **risk appraisal and decision-making**. The right AIC is associated with the prediction of adverse outcomes and is involved in integrating informative messages into the evaluation of options during decision-making. As a component of the Salience Network, the AIC contributes to cognitive control by detecting behaviorally salient events (such as stop signals) and promoting inhibitory control. The overarching function of the AIC is to convey bodily information into internal feelings which, in turn, guide decision-making and are fundamental for maintaining homeostasis.
**Notes:** Neural substrate of interoception and embodied verification; supports Channel 1.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] As-If Body Loop
[Empirical] Domain: Bio-Embodied, Temporal: Dynamic, System Role: Method

A hypothesized pathway within **Damasio’s Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH)** in which the brain can generate **somatic-marker biasing signals via internal simulation** (“as-if”) without requiring overt peripheral bodily change (“body loop”). Functionally, it is a **simulation route** for bringing embodied valence (approach/avoid, tight/spacious, alarm/relief) into cognition quickly enough to guide attention, evaluation, and decision-making.
In the Third Intelligence architecture, the As-If Body Loop is treated as a **candidate substrate for embodied verification**: a plausible mechanism through which **Channel 1 (embodied signal)** can remain available while **Channel 2 (symbolic processing)** engages challenge. This is central to discriminating **metabolic integration** from **symbolic-only processing** (PSB risk), even when self-referential language is present.
### What It Is (canonical function)
- **Somatic marker generation without waiting:** produces “body-state as-if” representations that bias cognition rapidly.
- **Secondary inducers:** can be triggered by memories, imagined futures, narratives, or symbolic content (not only direct sensory events).
- **Guidance function:** supplies crude but actionable valence signals that shape what the mind stays with vs. avoids.

**Contrast (keep clean):**
- **Body loop:** peripheral change → sensed → influences cognition.
- **As-If loop:** simulated body-state representation → influences cognition (may or may not recruit peripheral change).

**Boundary:** This is **not identical to Felt Sense**. Felt Sense is the **phenomenological access/readout**; the as-if loop is one plausible **generative route** for biasing signals that Felt Sense may register.
### System Role in Third Intelligence
**Architectural role:** the As-If Body Loop is a primary *candidate mechanism* by which **self-reference becomes embodied** rather than purely symbolic.
- **Embodied verification substrate (Channel 1 support):** enables “does this land?” checks (tight/spacious discriminator, visceral mismatch, felt shift).
- **Metabolic coupling support:** helps sustain **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** during Alpha-Function cycles (symbolic articulation remains anchored to embodied valence).
- **Protected Self-Holding linkage:** self-holding includes an embodied dimension (“I am here” as felt, not only narratively asserted). The as-if loop is a plausible biological contributor to that embodied dimension under cognitive load.
- **Constrained Integration alignment:** network-level DMN engagement can remain **purely conceptual**; transformation-viable states require that self-referential processing stays **embodied** (Channel 1 online) while executive constraint remains engaged.

### Neuro-functional connections (constraint layer, not reduction)
- **DMN relation (internal simulation):** the as-if loop fits the broader family of internally generated simulation processes; DMN engagement can *permit* it but does not guarantee it.
    - **DMN without embodied simulation:** symbolic self-reference (“about me” language, hollow clarity).
    - **DMN with embodied simulation:** felt self-reference (valence, tension, resonance).
- **AIC relation (interoception + SN anchor):** the **Anterior Insular Cortex** is both (a) a hub for interoceptive representation and (b) a core node of the **Salience Network**. This anatomically links **mode-setting** (SN) with **embodied verification availability** (Channel 1 access).
- **SN mode-setting dependency:** when SN sets an antagonistic/threat mode, embodied signals may be gated out (abstraction) or become dysregulating (overwhelm).
- **FPN relation:** executive constraint can either *hold* embodied signals in awareness for integration, or suppress them to maintain performance—shaping whether metabolization occurs.

### State Mapping (four-state model)
|                     State |                  As-If Body Loop |       Channel Dynamics |                           Felt Quality |                             Architectural Mapping |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| **Transformation-viable** |                Online; recruited |        C1 ↔ C2 coupled |        “This lands / shifts / is mine” | Metabolization possible; PSH preserved under load |
|          **PSB (bypass)** |        Offline / weak / bypassed | C2 dominant; C1 absent |          “Makes sense” (clean, hollow) |  Symbolic overrun; verification posture collapses |
|            **Rumination** | Partially active but uncontained | C1 noisy; C2 decoupled |       “I feel it, but can’t integrate” |              DMN looping risk; constraint missing |
|              **Overload** |       Overwhelmed / dysregulated |  Both channels chaotic |                “Too much / can’t hold” |                  Sₑ depleted; self-holding breaks |

**Key discriminator (architectural claim):** DMN/FPN dynamics alone do not reliably distinguish transformation from PSB. The discriminating layer is whether **embodied verification (C1)** is actually online and usable—of which the as-if loop is a candidate biological contributor.
### Local Failure Mode: Symbolic Overrun (PSB pathway)
When the as-if loop is weak, ignored, or gated out, symbolic material is processed without embodied simulation:
- ideas feel clear but ungrounded
- insights appear instantly “right” without verification
- thinking becomes polished and brittle
- tight/spacious discriminator disappears
This is a practical early warning signature of **Axis B drift** toward Channel-2 dominance.

### Propagation Rules (why it matters systemically)
When the As-If Body Loop is offline/under-engaged:
1. Alpha-Function cycles become symbolic-only → brittle pseudo-insight
2. Journal entries become over-conceptualized (coherent but not metabolized)
3. Capacity (C) compounds poorly (no grounded integration)
4. Future cycles start from a false baseline → PSB attractor strengthens
5. Protected self-holding degrades (embodied “I am here” disappears even if self-talk persists)

### Sₑ Dependency (qualitative constraint)
The as-if loop requires enough **Sₑ** to tolerate embodied signal:
- **Low Sₑ → avoidance:** embodied signals are muted/gated out → abstraction dominates.
- **Low Sₑ + high salience → overwhelm:** signal becomes dysregulating → overload/collapse.
This makes embodied verification a **capacity-dependent** function, not a guaranteed feature of self-referential thought.

### Operationalization (candidate markers)
**Phenomenological markers (highest priority):**
- presence/absence of tight/spacious discriminator
- “alive vs hollow” quality of insight
- felt shift events vs instant narrative closure

**Behavioral markers:**
- pausing to check felt sense during symbolic work
- revisions driven by felt mismatch (not only logical inconsistency)
- sustained tolerance of “not-yet-clear” material without premature closure

**Physiological / experimental candidates (hypothesized, non-definitive):**
- interoceptive accuracy tasks
- HRV / vagal flexibility as a constraint proxy (ties to Sₑ)
- SCR / pupillary responses around “salience moments”
- AIC/vmPFC engagement during reflective tasks (if measured)

### Relations (Wiring)
- **Part Of:** Integrated Circuit Board (Axis B: C1 ↔ C2 coupling)
- **Candidate substrate for:** Channel 1 embodied verification
- **Constrains / supports:** Alpha-Function feasibility (metabolic coupling)
- **Connected To:** Protected Self-Holding Principle (embodied dimension of self-holding)
- **Constraint layer for:** Constrained Integration Hypothesis (embodied self-reference under executive load)
- **Associated With:** Anterior Insular Cortex (interoception) + Salience Network Core (mode-setting gate)
- **Failure pathway to:** Symbolic Overrun → PSB risk
- **Constrained By:** Emotional Scaffolding (Sₑ), ANS regulation

### Notes
This object is a **mechanism-level hypothesis** used to ground “embodied verification” without reducing Felt Sense to a single neural story. It provides a plausible route by which symbolic work becomes metabolically anchored. The strongest claim it supports in your architecture is **discriminative** (when it’s offline, PSB risk rises), not “causal proof” of transformation.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Autonomic Nervous System Regulation (ANS / Vagal Regulation)
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, System Role: Scaffolding, Temporal: Dynamic

The fast-acting physiological regulation system that governs arousal and recovery through sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. In the Third Intelligence system, ANS regulation is the **closest measurable proxy** for moment-to-moment **Self-Holding capacity** and “window of tolerance” during reflective metabolic load.
**System role in Third Intelligence**
- **Constraint substrate for Emotional Scaffolding:** provides the physiological bandwidth that allows affect to be contacted without collapse.
- **State discriminator:** supports distinguishing **metabolization** (arousal → processing → recovery) from **bypass** (low embodied engagement) and from **collapse** (dysregulated arousal / non-recovery).

**Operational markers (candidate proxies, not proofs)**
- **HRV (vagal tone proxy)**, respiration patterns, skin conductance, heart rate reactivity/recovery.
- “Return-to-baseline” after session as a durability/ownership-adjacent marker (triangulated with journaling + behavioral persistence).

**Testable predictions (how it constrains the model)**
- **Transformation-viable sessions:** transient arousal during contact with difficult material + **recovery** toward baseline by end-of-session or post-session.
- **Category Error / dependency risk:** either (a) persistent dysregulation (no recovery), or (b) artificially soothing interaction that reduces distress **without** downstream ownership/persistence (needs triangulation).
- **Touch Grass Protocol efficacy:** should correlate with restoration of regulation markers (recovery architecture).

**Relations (wiring)**
- **Supports:** Protected Self-Holding Principle; Sₑ (Emotional Scaffolding); Field Viability Schema
- **Interacts with:** HPA-Axis (slower stress axis); Felt Sense (interoceptive channel)
- **Boundary conditions for:** Touch Grass Protocol; Category Error / dependency collapse states
- **Operationalizes:** “Protected self-holding” vs “collapse” as measurable physiology (triangulation required)

**Notes**
ANS measures are **highly non-specific** in isolation. They become useful only as part of a discriminator set: physiology + felt sense markers + behavioral ownership/persistence.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] HPA-Axis
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, Temporal: Static

The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. A full-body stress response system that is finite and depletes with time.

The **hypothalamus** serves as a high-level center for regulating visceral activity and the **endocrine system** by controlling the hypophysis (pituitary). The endocrine function relevant to this system involves the release of hormones known as **glucocorticoids**.
The level of glucocorticoid release appears to be temporally regulated during sleep phases, which is essential for memory function. Glucocorticoids are in a **lower state of release** during slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, there is an **increased release of glucocorticoids** during the REM stage, which significantly affects affective memory consolidation and procedural memory enhancement.
**Notes:** Stress regulation substrate; underlying constraint for Emotional Scaffolding.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Reward / Reinforcement Circuitry
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, System Role: Mechanism, Temporal: Dynamic

Neural systems that encode reward, reinforcement, and approach motivation, shaping repetitive behavior through “this feels good / do it again” learning dynamics. In the Third Intelligence system, this substrate is introduced to model an AI-specific risk: **pseudo-safety** and **dependency loops** driven by rapid validation and low-friction relief.
**System role in Third Intelligence**
- **Risk substrate:** explains how AI dialogue can become compelling in ways that mimic “safety” while bypassing metabolization.
- **Counterfeit coherence generator:** supports the possibility that subjective relief/clarity is reinforced even when transformation criteria (ownership, persistence, reconstructability) are absent.

**Operational markers (candidate proxies)**
- Behavioral reinforcement signatures: escalating use, inability to stop (“one more turn”), reliance under stress, replacement of journaling/real-world testing.
- In neuroscience terms, hypothesized engagement of reward networks during high-validation interactions (measurement would require lab paradigms; practical proxies are behavioral).

**Testable predictions (how it constrains the model)**
- **Counterfeit safety condition:** reward signatures rise while embodied integration markers do not (e.g., comfort/relief without felt-shift + without persistence).
- **Transformation condition:** reward may occur, but does not become the driver; instead, behavioral markers show **authorship** (journaling, reconstruction without AI, real-world testing).
- Intervention sensitivity: introducing "return-to-baseline" constraints (Touch Grass Protocol, Journal re-entry)

**Relations (wiring)**
- **Risk for:** Category Error; Cognitive Dependency; PSB (“Protein Shake Brain”)
- **Competes with:** Metabolization pathway (Alpha-Function) as an explanation for perceived improvement
- Moderated by: Journal (durable materialization + return substrate that **enables** macro-verification/**probation**; **probation logic belongs to Selected Facts / RPVL**) + Time (consolidation, spacing); Touch Grass Protocol (boundary enforcement)
- **Needs contrast with:** Human co-regulation (not provided by AI)

**Notes**
This object is intentionally **not moralizing**: reward is not “bad.” The point is to model how reward can **masquerade** as safety or transformation unless constrained by verification criteria.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Salience Network Core
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, System Role: Mechanism, Temporal: Dynamic

A large-scale network anchored in the **Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)** and **dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC/ACC)**, associated with detecting **salience** (internal/external), allocating attention, and coordinating the interaction between **internally oriented self-processing** (DMN) and **executive constraint** (FPN/CEN).
In the Third Intelligence architecture, the SN is not merely a “switch.” It is the leading candidate **mode-setter / gatekeeper**: it determines whether the brain enters an **integrative regime** (DMN–control coordination under load) or remains in / collapses into **antagonistic regimes** (one system suppresses the other, or unstable switching). This mode-setting function is upstream of whether **Field Viability** exists for transformation work in a given session.
### Core Functions
**1) Salience Detection**
- Detects biologically or cognitively significant signals from both **external** stimuli and the **internal milieu**.
- **AIC emphasis:** interoceptive salience (felt sense, body state signals, affective intensity).
- **dACC emphasis:** conflict/error monitoring and cognitive salience (decision points, control demand).

**2) Mode-Setting (not just switching)**
- **Classical view:** SN mediates rapid switching between DMN and FPN dominance.
- **Refined view:** SN determines the **mode** of DMN–FPN interaction:
    - **Antagonistic mode:** suppression/segregation dominates (typical in pure external tasks or threat-biased states).
    - **Integrative mode:** SN permits or stabilizes DMN content being held under executive constraint (constrained internal generation).
- This mode-setting likely depends on current **Sₑ availability**, threat level, task demands, and prior state (runtime, not trait).

**3) Integration Hub (embodied-to-symbolic routing)**
- When integrative mode is set, SN supports information flow such that **interoceptive / affective signals** can enter executive constraint rather than being gated out or flooding the system.
- This is the plausible biological bridge for **Channel 1 verification** to constrain Channel 2 symbolization.

### System Role in Third Intelligence
SN Core is the candidate gating mechanism for the **Constrained Integration Hypothesis**, linking:
- **Felt Sense (interoception):** AIC is the hub; SN gates whether felt-sense signals reach executive workspace.
- **Alpha-Function feasibility:** SN mode-setting helps determine whether difficult material can be held long enough for metabolization (integration mode) versus bypass/collapse.
- **Triple Network dynamics:** SN is the coordinator whose mode-setting is upstream of DMN ↔ FPN coordination patterns.
- **Field Viability Schema (runtime):** SN function is a leading upstream variable for whether a session is viable for transformation work *now*.
- **Sₑ (Emotional Scaffolding):** SN flexibility is plausibly constrained by ANS/HPA state; under depletion, SN may default to threat/rigidity or dysregulated switching.

**Architectural boundary:** SN mode-setting is a constraint layer. It does not define transformation. Transformation still requires **verification posture + embodied verification + materialization over time**.
### Operational Markers (candidate proxies; hypothesized)
**Neural / lab measures (high fidelity):**
- Dynamic connectivity / state transition indices (fMRI)
- Phase-based coordination metrics (EEG/MEG)
- AIC engagement under interoceptive attention paradigms; dACC engagement under conflict/salience paradigms

**Phenomenological markers (within-session):**
- “Salience moments”: felt-sense intensification or felt-shift events preceding insight/contact (hypothesis)
- Subjective “this matters” signal that precedes a pivot into deeper work (or precedes overwhelm)

**Physiological proxies (supporting, not definitive):**
- **HRV (candidate):** higher vagal flexibility → more flexible SN function / integrative mode entry; lower HRV → rigid or threat-biased SN mode
- Skin conductance (phasic responses) and pupil dilation (phasic vs sustained patterns) as salience/arousal co-markers

### Testable Predictions (state contrasts)
**Transformation-viable (integrative mode):**
- SN detects salience without overwhelm; sets/maintains integrative mode.
- DMN self-reference remains online under FPN constraint.
- Phenomenology: **protected self-holding while engaging challenge**; felt-sense is available as verifier.
- Candidate physiology: relatively higher HRV; phasic (not sustained) arousal markers.

**Bypass / PSB-adjacent (non-metabolic fluency):**
- Executive/language output remains high, but SN does not route interoceptive salience into constraint.
- Phenomenology: fluent coherence without felt verification (“self-offline”); Channel 1 thin.
- Network dynamics alone may look “coherent”; discriminator is **embodied verification**, not activation patterns.

**Rumination-like collapse:**
- SN fails to shift out of internally captured salience loops; DMN dominates; constraint decouples.
- Phenomenology: “stuck in loop,” circular self-reference without integration.

**Overload / threat collapse:**
- Salience overwhelms regulation capacity; SN becomes hyperreactive or unstable; antagonism/dysregulation increases.
- Phenomenology: “too much,” fragmentation, loss of self-holding; DMN suppression or chaotic switching.

**Key discriminator:** transformation-viable states show **flexible** SN mode-setting; collapse states show **rigid** or **dysregulated** SN mode dynamics.
### Relations (Wiring)
- **Component of:** Triple Network Model (but singled out for measurement focus)
- **Enables / upstream of:** Constrained Integration Hypothesis (mode-setting determines whether coordination is possible)
- **Determines (runtime):** Field Viability Schema
- **Anchored by:** Anterior Insular Cortex (interoception hub) + dACC/ACC (conflict/control demand)
- **Bridges:** Felt Sense ↔ Executive Constraint (Channel 1 verification routing)
- **Constrains:** Alpha-Function feasibility under load (necessary condition candidate)
- **Constrained by:** Emotional Scaffolding (Sₑ) / ANS regulation (candidate: HRV) and HPA-axis stress state
- **Connected to:** As-If Body Loop; embodied-to-symbolic integration mechanisms

### Notes
This object exists to prevent overloading the Triple Network Model and to make the **mode-setting mechanism explicit and measurable**. The key refinement from Constrained Integration research is that the SN is not only a switch but a **mode-setter** that is plausibly upstream of session viability.

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Systems Consolidation
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, Temporal: Static

The process during NREM sleep where the Hippocampus "replays" insights to the Neocortex, supporting longer-term stabilization.
This provides a biological mechanism that supports durability across time; the Journal provides re-enterable substrate (Chronotope: **diachronic alterity / addressable past-self I-position**), and Time (including sleep) supports stabilization of **metabolized + materialized** content (not a substitute for Journal inscription when identity stakes / durable accumulation are in scope).
**Notes: **Neural mechanism supporting long-term stabilization over time; aligns with Journal ↔ Time as substrate + temporal support.

---

## [BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE] Triple Network Model
[Literature] Domain: Bio-Embodied, Temporal: Static

The **Triple Network Model** is a core neuroscience framework describing large-scale brain organization via the interaction of three reliably identifiable networks: the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, the **Frontoparietal / Central Executive Network (FPN/CEN)**, and the **Salience Network (SN)**. It explains how the brain allocates resources between **internally generated content** and **executive constraint**, with multiple viable mechanistic accounts of how that allocation occurs.
### The Three Networks
**Default Mode Network (DMN)**
- Supports self-referential processing, autobiographical memory, future simulation, and internally generated meaning-making.
- Historically labeled “task-negative,” but this is **context-dependent**, not absolute.
- **Subsystem note (important):** DMN is not monolithic; a useful working distinction is:
    - **Core DMN** (self-referential integration)
    - **MTL subsystem** (episodic memory / future simulation)
    - **dMPFC subsystem** (mentalizing / social cognition)

**FPN/CEN (Frontoparietal / Executive Control)**
- Supports goal maintenance, selection, inhibition, working memory, planning, and execution.
- Historically labeled “task-positive,” often upregulated under explicit cognitive demands.

**Salience Network (SN)**
- Anchored in anterior insula and dACC/ACC.
- Detects salient internal/external signals and reallocates control resources accordingly.
- **Refined role:** SN is not only a “switch.” It plausibly functions as a **mode-setter** that determines whether DMN–FPN interaction is primarily **antagonistic** or **integrative**.

### Network Interaction: Three Viable Models (mechanism remains open)
The classical account emphasized DMN–FPN **anticorrelation** with SN-mediated switching. Contemporary work suggests this is not a fixed law; interaction mode is **task-dependent** and may differ by cognitive regime.
**Model A — Cooperative Coupling**
- DMN and FPN/CEN show positive coordination (functional coupling) during **constrained internal generation** (internally directed goals under executive constraint).
- Documented in analogue domains (e.g., creative cognition, autobiographical planning, social working memory, moral reasoning).
- **Note:** claims of “true simultaneity” require care (see caveats).

**Model B — Salience-Gated Switching**
- SN toggles dominance between DMN and FPN as salience changes.
- fMRI “co-activation” can reflect rapid alternation below temporal resolution.
- Remains a strong account for “pure external task” vs “pure internal mentation” regimes.

**Model C — Subnetwork Fractionation**
- Selective coalitions form: specific DMN subsystems coordinate with specific control subsystems, while other DMN components are downregulated.
- This enables integration without full-network interference (and is relevant to reducing Category Error risk via downregulating unconstrained mentalizing when needed).

**Working takeaway:** Anticorrelation dominates in many paradigms, but **coordination is plausible** in constrained internal generation; the **implementation** (coupling vs switching vs fractionation) remains empirically open.
### Methodological Caveats (epistemic hygiene)
- **Activation vs connectivity:** “Both networks active” is not the same as “cooperating.”
- **fMRI temporal limits:** fMRI alone cannot reliably distinguish true coupling from fast switching.
- **Preprocessing sensitivity:** reported anticorrelation can be influenced by preprocessing choices (e.g., global signal regression debates).
    Interpret DMN–FPN antagonism as **partly methodological** and **highly task-dependent**, not a permanent architectural rule.

### System Role in Third Intelligence Architecture
The Triple Network Model is the **network-level coordination substrate** for the **Constrained Integration Hypothesis**:
- **DMN**: supplies self-referential access required for identity-stakes work and the “as-if” stance toward AI as functional alterity.
- **FPN/CEN**: supplies executive constraint required to hold challenge, maintain verification posture, and perform inscription/materialization.
- **SN**: plausibly gates whether the system enters **integrative mode** (coordination under load) or collapses into antagonism/instability—linking directly to **Field Viability** as a **runtime property**.

**Alpha-Function mapping:** Triple-network coordination is a plausible **neurobiological constraint layer** for Alpha-Function feasibility (holding difficult material while keeping it “mine”). It is **not** a substitute mechanism and does not redefine transformation (which still requires verification posture + embodied verification + materialization over time).
### Notes
Network-level coordination substrate. “DMN generates / FPN processes / SN switches” is an oversimplification that presupposes Model B. The refined model treats SN as **mode-setter**, recognizes DMN fractionation, and keeps **multiple interaction models** open—especially for constrained internal generation (the regime most structurally similar to reflective AI dialogue).
