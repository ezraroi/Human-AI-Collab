## [TOOL] AI Project (Claude Project, ChatGPT Project)

The specific computational container that stores accumulated journals, enabling cross-temporal pattern recognition.
Creates a **Persistent Semantic Network**. It allows the AI to search across **stored Journal entries (and, secondarily, conversation context as a weak substrate)**, connect ideas from different contexts, and recognize patterns that emerge slowly over time.
The Journal is the content; the Project is the storage infrastructure that enables AI to perform cross-temporal pattern recognition as **idiom-preserving structuration** (surfacing structure from the user’s idiom corpus, not importing foreign frameworks).
**Relations:**
- Link to **Journal** (Relation: `Stores`).
- Link to AI (Relation: Container Within / Feature Of).
