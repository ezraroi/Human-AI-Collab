## [TOOL] AI Project (Claude Project, ChatGPT Project)

The specific computational container that stores accumulated journals, enabling cross-temporal pattern recognition.
Creates a **Persistent Semantic Network**. It allows the AI to search across conversations, connect ideas from different contexts, and recognize patterns that emerge slowly over time.
The Journal is the content; The Project is the pattern-recognition engine.
**Relations:**
- Link to **Journal** (Relation: `Stores`).
- Link to **AI** (Relation: `Instance Of`).
