## [TOOL] AI Project (Claude Project, ChatGPT Project)

The specific computational container that stores accumulated journals, enabling cross-temporal pattern recognition.
Creates a **Persistent Semantic Network**. It allows the AI to search across conversations, connect ideas from different contexts, and recognize patterns that emerge slowly over time.
The Journal is the content; the Project is the **storage infrastructure** that enables AI to perform cross-temporal pattern recognition.
**Relations:**
- Link to **Journal** (Relation: `Stores`).
- Link to AI (Relation: Container Within / Feature Of).
