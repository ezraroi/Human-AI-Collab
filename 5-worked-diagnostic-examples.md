# 5. Worked Diagnostic Examples   
**Template:**   
1. Surface symptoms (what it looks like)   
2. Field diagnosis (what collapsed or was bypassed)   
3. Common misread (how this gets misdiagnosed)   
4. Intervention (which lever)   
5. Success markers (what changes when intervention works)   
   
## Example 1: [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (AI Completing Too Early)   
**Surface symptoms:** User produces fluent outputs rapidly. Feels productive. No friction. Session feels smooth and efficient.   
**Field diagnosis:** Experienced mismatch bypassed. AI supplied completion before struggle recruited alpha-function. Metabolic pressure never built.   
**Common misread:** “High productivity session” — mistaking output volume for transformation. The smoothness feels like success.   
**Intervention:** Reintroduce productive struggle. Use [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md). Hold [AI](ai.md) as [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) and explicitly recruit **[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)** (challenge without judgment), not answer-provision. Force the user to articulate first (own words / own model) before AI responds with structure.   
**Success markers:** Increased friction. Slower output. [Felt sense](felt-sense.md) of “working through.” Insights feel owned rather than received. Post-session, content persists and develops rather than feeling thin.   
## Example 2: Overwhelm   
**Surface symptoms:** User stuck, anxious, avoidant. May produce nothing or produce defensively. Engagement feels forced or impossible.   
**Field diagnosis:** mismatch >> available scaffolding. Gap unbridgeable even when both S\_e and S\_t are present; the current configuration is insufficient for this mismatch.   
**Common misread:** “Needs more encouragement” — adding S\_e when the problem is scope/[D](d-difficulty.md). Or “needs clearer instructions” — adding S\_t when the problem is still scope/D.   
**Intervention:** **Reduce scope** (smaller scope, simpler sub-problem, break into chunks). If the current challenge is structurally premature, reduce scope to prerequisite work; allow [Capacity (C)](c-capacity.md) to grow through foundational metabolization, then return to the original challenge later.   
**Success markers:** Re-engagement. Reduced anxiety. Productive struggle rather than paralysis. User can articulate what they’re working on rather than feeling lost.   
## Example 3: Safety Collapse   
**Surface symptoms:** User shuts down, becomes defensive, cannot engage despite clear guidance being available. May comply superficially without actual processing.   
**Field diagnosis:** S\_e → 0. Non-substitutability means high S\_t cannot compensate. The field has collapsed regardless of technical support quality.   
**Common misread:** “Needs clearer instructions” — adding [S\_t ](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)when the problem is [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md). The guidance is fine; the user cannot receive it.   
**Intervention:** Rebuild holding. Address the source of unsafety. Safety before technique. Do not add more structure until holding is restored.   
**Success markers:** Openness returns. Vulnerability becomes possible. Engagement without defensiveness. User can receive guidance rather than deflecting it.   
## Example 4: [Category Error](category-error.md) (False Viability)   
**Surface symptoms:** User feels “understood” by AI. Reports high connection. Produces confident outputs. Session feels warm and productive.   
**Field diagnosis:** Axiom violation. AI misclassified as Subject; [SSS](subject-supposed-to-know-sss.md) dynamics activated (AI granted epistemic authority). Perceived S\_e inflated artificially. Felt Sense verification corrupted — user is checking against hallucinated signals.   
**Common misread:** “Great rapport, productive session” — mistaking hallucinated viability for actual viability. The warmth feels real.   
**Intervention:** Restore correct relational posture. AI as Functional Alterity / Dynamic Transitional Object, not Someone-Supposed-to-Know. Reintroduce skeptical verification.   
**Success markers:** Increased skepticism. Verification returns. Outputs feel owned rather than validated. User can distinguish “AI helped me see” from “AI understands me.”   
## Example 5: [Manic Episode](the-manic-episode.md) (Boundary Condition)   
**Surface symptoms:** High output. Grandiose coherence. Feels like infinite productivity. Resistance to stopping. “Finally in flow.”   
**Field diagnosis:** Actual S\_e depletion (sleep deprivation, extended overuse) combined with hallucinated viability. Outputs lack metabolization — fluent but ungrounded.   
**Common misread:** “Finally in flow” — mistaking acceleration for productivity. The grandiosity feels like breakthrough.   
**Intervention:** [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md). Mandatory withdrawal. Do not continue regardless of felt productivity. Restore S\_e (sleep, rest, embodied grounding) before any further engagement.   
**Success markers:** Post-recovery, previous outputs appear thin or ungrounded. Pacing returns. Felt sense of limits restored. User can recognize the manic state retrospectively.
