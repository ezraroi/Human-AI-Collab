# Reflective Awareness   
The immediate, tacit awareness inherent to any experience. It is the first-personal "mineness" of experience—not a thought *about* experience, but the feeling *of* experience itself.
**Character:** Immediate, non-observational, tacit, passive, spontaneous.
Model Equivalent: It maps to [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (Embodied / Sensorimotor–Interoceptive) and is the domain of the [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md).   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Maurice Merleau-Ponty](maurice-merleau-ponty.md)** (Relation: `Defined By`).   
- Link to **[Anterior Insular Cortex](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md)** (Relation: `Neural Substrate Of`).
