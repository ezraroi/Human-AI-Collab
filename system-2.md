      1.3. The Novice-to-Expert Gap

# System 2   
**System 2** is a human cognitive framework characterized by **slow, analytical, and reflective thinking**.   
Key characteristics include:   
• **Nature:** It is **deliberative, computational, and rule-governed**.   
• **Function:** It is employed for making judgments in **unfamiliar situations** and when there is **more time to figure things out**. It is relied upon for **complex, novel, high-stakes, and highly integrative problems**.   
• **Mechanism:** It relies on **well-articulated reasons and fully developed evidence**, and involves processing abstract concepts, planning ahead, and careful consideration of options.   
• **Context:** It functions alongside System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking). Improving critical thinking skills helps develop and refine System 2 reasoning.   
**Example:**   
If you’re running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in?   
For many, the instant answer that pops into mind is "first place." That’s System 1 jumping to a plausible but incorrect conclusion. If you pause and engage System 2, you'll realize that if you pass the person in second, you take their place. You are now in second place.
