# System 2   
System 2 is the component of [Daniel Kahneman](daniel-kahneman.md)’s dual-process framework for human thinking responsible for higher-level cognitive activity, including slow, deliberate, and reflective reasoning.   
**Key characteristics include:**   
- **Process Nature:** Slow, deliberative, effortful, and attention-demanding reasoning.   
- **Cognitive Function:** Analytical thinking focused on logical evaluation, explicit reasons, and evidence-based judgment; supports planning and careful comparison of options.   
- **Role in Decision-Making:** In judgment and evaluation—especially under novelty, complexity, or high stakes—System 2 can be recruited to scrutinize and correct intuitive (System 1) outputs rather than passively accepting them. In decision-support contexts, design often aims to *encourage engagement of System 2* to reduce uncritical acceptance of suggestions.   
- **Cognitive Cost and Failure Modes:** Engaging System 2 carries a cognitive cost; people weigh this cost against perceived benefit. System 2 can also manifest as **overly critical analysis** when assessing external inputs (e.g., AI suggestions), leading to excessive skepticism rather than calibrated evaluation.   
- **Context (System 0):** In models that include **[System 0](system-0.md)** as an algorithmic preprocessing layer, System 2 operates on inputs shaped by that preprocessing (e.g., what is surfaced, framed, or made salient), alongside and in interaction with [System 1](system-1.md).   
   
**Example:**   
If you’re running a race and you pass the person in second place, what place are you in? System 1 may answer “first,” but System 2 checks the logic and concludes you are now in **second**.
