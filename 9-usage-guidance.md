# 9. Usage Guidance   
### When to Reach for the Formula   
Strong use cases:   
- Transformation failed and you need to understand why   
- Comparing structural patterns across different contexts   
- Designing new intervention and checking completeness   
- Explaining to others why certain approaches fail/succeed   
- Teaching the system logic to practitioners   
   
Moderate use cases:   
- Analyzing ongoing session while it's happening   
- Predicting likely failure modes in design phase   
- Communicating research findings   
   
Weak use cases:   
- Single-moment prediction of specific outcomes   
- Comparing individuals or groups   
- Creating assessment metrics   
   
### How to Use It (Step-by-Step)   
For Diagnostic Analysis:   
1. Describe the situation clearly   
    - What was the context?   
    - What transformation was attempted?   
    - What was the outcome?   
2. Map to components   
    - S\_e: How safe did person feel? Trust present?   
    - S\_t: What guidance/structure was provided?   
    - D: How difficult/complex was the task?   
    - C: What was person's current capacity?   
3. Calculate relationships (conceptually)   
    - Was challenge matched to capacity?   
    - Were both scaffolds present?   
    - Which component was the bottleneck?   
4. Identify failure mode   
    - Safety Collapse? Challenge Void? Overwhelm?   
    - Which named pattern does it match?   
5. Design intervention   
    - Target the specific bottleneck   
    - Don't add technique when safety is missing   
    - Don't add safety when challenge is wrong   
   
For Pattern Recognition:   
1. Observe phenomenon in Context A   
    - Map to formula components   
2. Observe different phenomenon in Context B   
    - Map to formula components   
3. Compare structural patterns   
    - Same failure mode? Different domains?   
    - Reveals underlying unity   
4. Apply learnings across contexts   
    - Solution from A might work in B   
    - Same intervention logic applies   
   
### What to Say About the Formula   
When explaining to others:   
DO say:   
- "This is a relational schema showing how components interact"   
- "It helps us diagnose which component is the bottleneck"   
- "Think of it as a concept map, not a calculation"   
- "It reveals why both safety AND guidance are required"   
   
DON'T say:   
- "We can calculate your P(α) score"   
- "Let me measure your S\_e level"   
- "This predicts whether transformation will happen"   
- "Higher P(α) means better person/system"   
   
Critical framing:   
- Lead with system architecture, introduce formula second   
- Show worked examples of diagnosis, not calculation   
- Emphasize pattern recognition across contexts   
- Use named failure modes as teaching tool
