# 3.The Mechanism vs. Existence Distinction   
### What Is Actually Being Claimed?   
The [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system operates through identifiable causal dynamics. The **[Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)** — *(S\_e ⊗ S\_t) calibrated to mismatch(D, C)* — provides a **diagnostic framework** for these dynamics, enabling process tracing and causal pathway identification rather than mere existence proof.   
|    Claim Type |                                                  Statement |                                 Evidence Required |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
|     Existence |               "Transformation via AI dialogue is possible" |             Single documented instance sufficient |
|     Mechanism | "When transformation occurs, the system operates this way" |    Process tracing, causal pathway identification |
| Replicability |                         "Others can reproduce this method" | Procedural documentation, transferable components |

**The Resolution:** The study claims **[Analytic Generalization](analytic-generalization.md) of mechanism** — not statistical generalization to population. The argument becomes: *"I have isolated the gears of this machine. I cannot prove this machine exists in your context, but I have proven that these gears, assembled this way, produce this motion."*
