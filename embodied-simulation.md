# Embodied Simulation   
The mechanism where symbolic input [(Channel 2)](channel-2-symbolic.md) can recruit embodied simulation that supports [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) engagement. "Reading 'kick' activates the foot motor cortex.   
It is hypothesized that **predictions are embodied simulations of sensory motor experiences**. In this context, a simulation is described as an **embodied brain state**. This mechanism is related to bodily simulation that can support embodied understanding.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)** (Relation: `Relies On`).   
- Link to Link to[ Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (Embodied / Sensorimotor–Interoceptive)   
- Link to **[Channel 2 (Symbolic)](channel-2-symbolic.md)** (Relation: `Triggered By`).   
   
**Notes:** Words → sensorimotor activation; substrate for Channel 1 engagement.
