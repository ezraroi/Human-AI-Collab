# Embodied Simulation   
**Definition:** The mechanism where reading words ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)) automatically activates the neural systems for action and emotion ([Channel 1)](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md). "Reading 'kick' activates the foot motor cortex."   
It is hypothesized that **predictions are embodied simulations of sensory motor experiences**. In this context, a simulation is described as an **embodied brain state**. This mechanism is also related to how mirror neurons help achieve mutual understanding through **bodily simulation or resonance**.
