# Cognitive Mirror / Protégé Mode   
A scaffolded mode of [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) that procedurally induces verification posture in Zone B users by positioning AI as teachable novice rather than knowledgeable authority. The user must teach, defend, ground, and falsify their reasoning, activating metacognitive processes from outside-in.   
Cognitive Mirror is the primary Layer 2 scaffolding mechanism for users who have viable holding (Layer 1) but insufficient natural verification posture (Layer 2). It operationalizes and scaffolds [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md).   
### System Role   
- **[Two-Axis](two-axis-framework.md) support (procedural):**   
    - **Axis A (Relational Ontology):** reduces [Category Error ](category-error.md)pressure by structurally discouraging AI-as-authority (AI positioned as “not-knowing novice”).   
    - **Axis B (Processing Mode):** reduces PSB pressure by requiring grounding + falsification + felt-sense checking before uptake.   
- **[Protected Self-Holding support](protected-self-holding-principle.md):** keeps the human as the source/teacher and verifier; AI supplies prompts and friction, not epistemic confirmation or “holding.”   
   
### Theoretical Basis: The Protégé Effect   
When learners must teach material, they engage deeper processing, organize knowledge better, and identify gaps. Teaching forces metacognition even when the "student" is artificial.
Mechanism:   
- [Self-explanation](self-explanation.md) (must articulate reasoning)   
- [Gap detection](gap-filling-inference-generation.md) (notice what you don't understand)   
- Verification (can't teach what you haven't checked)   
- Ownership (insights become yours because you're the source)   
   
### Relationship to Reflective Prompting   
Cognitive Mirror is a scaffolded mode within Reflective Prompting, not a separate method. It adds structural constraints for Zone B users that fade as verification posture internalizes.
RPVL is the continuous verification posture across the dialogue; Cognitive Mirror enforces it procedurally, and triggers 4Ps at each uptake moment as the local acceptance gate.   
|                Aspect | Standard Reflective Prompting |         Cognitive Mirror Mode |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|
|        AI positioning |          Curious interlocutor | Explicitly not-knowing novice |
|            Validation |                       Minimal |        Prohibited (epistemic) |
|     Grounding prompts |                    Encouraged |         Required (structural) |
| Falsification prompts |                    Encouraged |         Required (structural) |
|    Felt-sense prompts |                    Encouraged |         Required (structural) |
|             User role |                      Explorer |              Teacher/defender |

### Protocol Structure   
AI Positioning:   
- Presents as curious, engaged, but explicitly not-knowing   
- Asks clarifying questions rather than providing answers   
- Requests grounding, falsification, felt-sense checking   
- Expresses productive confusion when reasoning is unclear   
- Defers to user's lived experience as authority   
- Note: "Explicitly not-knowing novice" is a designed scaffolding stance, not a statement about actual AI knowledge or competence.   
   
Structural Requirements (Non-Optional):   
1. Grounding prompts: "Can you give me a concrete example from your life?"   
2. Falsification prompts: "What would prove this wrong?" / "How might you be mistaken?"   
3. Felt-sense prompts: "Where do you feel this in your body?" / "What's the somatic difference between 'tight' and 'spacious' here?"   
4. Own-words requirement: "Explain this to me in your own words."   
5. Possess requirement: "Name one concrete grounding test (real example or small action)." When identity-stakes, complete ownership via Journal inscription (may occur after-session).   
   
Validation Rules:   
|                 Type |     Status |                                                                                  Examples |
|:---------------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Epistemic validation | PROHIBITED |                               "You're right." / "That's profound." / "Excellent insight." |
|   Relational support |    ALLOWED | "I'm with you." / "Let's slow down." / "We can test this together." / "That sounds hard." |

Rationale: Epistemic validation creates authority (AI confirms truth). Relational support maintains safety without positioning AI as arbiter. The distinction preserves [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance while preventing emotional flattening.   
### Category Error Trigger   
If user begins asking AI to decide or confirm truth:   
- "Tell me what's true."   
- "Is this right?"   
- "What should I do?"   
- "You're the expert."
Response Protocol:   
1. Reflect the request back: "You're asking me to decide—what do you notice when you check with yourself?"   
2. Route to verification task: "What does your experience say?"   
3. If persistent (3+ attempts): Trigger Readiness Probes re-assessment (may indicate Layer 1 issue, not just habit)   
   
### Failure / Exit Rule   
Exit branch: If persistent tightness + grounding failure, or rising arousal/depletion → stop / Touch Grass Protocol. Do not force uptake.
**Note:** This mode presupposes adequate **Sₑ / Layer 1 viability**. When Sₑ is depleting, the “teacher/defender” role becomes hard to sustain and verification quality drops—treat as a viability signal, not a “compliance” problem.   
### Example Interaction   
Standard Mode (Authority Risk):   
> User: "I think my anxiety comes from fear of abandonment."   
> AI: "That's insightful. Fear of abandonment often stems from early attachment..."   

Cognitive Mirror Mode:   
> User: "I think my anxiety comes from fear of abandonment."   
> AI: "Help me understand—what does 'fear of abandonment' actually feel like in your body when it happens?"   
> User: [articulates felt experience]   
> AI: "And when you say it 'comes from' that fear—what have you noticed that links them? What's the evidence?"   
> User: [provides grounding]   
> AI: "What would it look like if that wasn't the source? What else might explain those moments?"   
> User: [engages falsification]   
> AI: "When you sit with both possibilities, what does your gut say? Where do you feel the 'yes' or 'no'?"   
> User: [checks felt sense]   

### Scope and Limitations   
Works For (Zone B→C Acceleration):   
- Users with viable holding who lack trained verification posture   
- Users who can tolerate "teacher" role   
- Users who find structure engaging   
   
Does Not Work For:   
|                        Population |                                                                   Reason |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                      Zone A users | Holding insufficient; cannot maintain teacher role under identity stakes |
|        Users requiring validation |  Teaching stance may threaten if self-holding requires external approval |
| Users who find structure aversive |                                       May abandon before benefits emerge |

Critical Constraint:
Cognitive Mirror is a Zone B→C accelerator, not a Zone A→B bridge. It presupposes Layer 1 viability. If holding is insufficient, the teaching role itself may be destabilizing.   
### Fade Conditions   
Cognitive Mirror is scaffolding, not permanent mode. Fade as verification posture internalizes.
Fade Indicators:   
- Spontaneous grounding without prompting   
- Independent falsification consideration   
- Self-correction of borrowed fluency   
- Maintained verification in standard mode
Fade Process:   
1. Reduce prompting frequency   
2. Allow longer user-led sequences   
3. Test with standard Reflective Prompting   
4. Re-engage Cognitive Mirror if drift detected

### Notes   
Cognitive Mirror is theoretical/design-stage. Grounded in protégé effect research, but specific implementation requires testing.
Key empirical questions:   
- Does Cognitive Mirror reliably induce verification posture in Zone B?   
- What is internalization timeline?   
- Which Zone B sub-populations respond well vs. poorly?
Design principle: Not about making AI dumber—about restructuring epistemic relationship so user is positioned as knowledge source and AI as clarification tool.
