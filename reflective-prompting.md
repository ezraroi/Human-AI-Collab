# Reflective Prompting   
Reflective Prompting (RP) is a structured prompting protocol that uses AI as a **reflective surface** rather than a substitute thinker. RP keeps **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) capacity with the human**, organizes **technical scaffolding (Sₜ)** so it amplifies (not replaces) metabolic work, and prevents premature collapse of experienced challenge inside the [ZPD](zpd.md) by slowing work into **recursive reflective loops** (while the structural Challenge Gap remains pre-existing).   
**Network-level framing (Constrained Integration layer):** RP is the session protocol designed to *establish and maintain* the transformation-viable conditions hypothesized by Constrained Integration:   
- **Sₑ adequate** (physiological gate)   
- **SN integrative mode** (mode-setting)   
- **DMN–FPN coordination under challenge** (reflect + constrain)   
- **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) online** (Channel 1 / embodied verification accessible)   
- **[Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) maintained** (phenomenological invariant; [human](human.md) retains container function)   
   
**[Two-Axis](two-axis-framework.md) positioning:** RP is the primary method for maintaining the viable quadrant:   
- **Axis A:** DTO stance (prevents [Category Error](category-error.md) / AI-as-Subject)   
- **Axis B:** Metabolic processing (prevents [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) / [Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only bypass)   
   
Its purpose is to prevent PSB, preserve authorship, and produce **owned [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)** by routing insights through mandatory verification (RPVL).   
### System Role   
- Converts AI interaction from **consumption** into **co-articulation under verification**.   
- Preserves **[Productive Epistemic Tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md) (PET)** by preventing frictionless resolution and enforcing metabolizable pacing.   
- Keeps AI as a **Piagetian Tool (Object)** serving the human container (Iron Man Mentality), not a pseudo-[MKO](mko-more-knowledgeable-other.md).   
- Provides the **session container** within which metabolic work begins in dialogue and becomes durable through inscription.   
   
**Network-level function (hypothesized correlates):**   
|                  Component |                                                   RP’s primary effect |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                     **Sₑ** |     Explicit monitoring + escalation; avoids “work through depletion” |
|                **SN mode** |      Supports integrative mode by calibrated challenge + verification |
|                **DMN–FPN** |              Stabilizes alternation/coupling: reflection ↔ constraint |
|        **As-If Body Loop** |    Kept online by mandatory felt-sense checks (Channel 1 recruitment) |
| **Protected Self-Holding** |             Maintained by stance + non-delegables + owned inscription |

### Scope & Preconditions   
### Use RP when   
- The task has **identity/developmental stakes** (writing, role decisions, strategy, deep self-understanding, complex design).   
- The goal includes **[Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) growth over time**, not only completion.   
- **Sₑ is sufficiently stable** (envelope not collapsed).   
- The outcome must become **durable** → Journal is required (decisions, reframes, Selected Facts probation, identity-level shifts).   
   
### Transactional mode is acceptable when   
- Tasks are purely instrumental and low-stakes.   
- Speed over depth is a conscious trade.   
   
### Requires (postures)   
- [Metacognition](metacognition.md) (monitor + regulate)   
- [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md) (dual skepticism: AI + self-perception)   
- [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md) (human as pilot; AI as suit)   
- RPVL (mandatory verification stance)   
- [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) discipline (Category Error resistance)   
   
## Four-Phase Protocol (with network-level rationale)   
### Phase 1 — Preparation (“Cognitive Canvas”)   
**Function:** establish baseline and viability before engagement.   
**Operations**   
- Define: what would count as a **real shift**?   
- Inventory: constraints, context, relevant prior notes / Journal.   
- Declare **non-delegables** (judgment/meaning/narrative) vs delegables (editing/formatting/etc.).   
- Quick **Sₑ check**: spacious vs tight; workable vs overloaded.   
   
**Network rationale (hypothesized)**   
- Prevents entering challenge with collapsed Sₑ (keeps SN from defaulting to threat/antagonistic mode).   
- Engages FPN by clarifying goals/constraints (executive authority stays with human).   
- Anchors Protected Self-Holding by stating ownership boundaries early.   
   
### Phase 2 — Reflection & Warm-Up (ERV + continuous RPVL)   
**Function:** build a precise “box of meaning” before heavy outputs.   
**Turn-Structure: ERV**   
1. **Externalize** — raw thoughts/confusions/stakes (often Rubber Duck Debugging).   
2. **Refine** — push back; reject flattery/premature coherence; demand alternatives.   
3. **Validate** — request synthesis; check against felt sense + task definition; recycle if off.   
   
**Network rationale (hypothesized)**   
- Externalize recruits DMN self-reference (material surfaces).   
- Refine recruits FPN constraint + authorship (prevents AI-as-authority drift).   
- Validate explicitly recruits the **As-If Body Loop** via felt-sense checking (Channel 1 online), enabling metabolic discrimination (PSB vs transformation).   
   
**Key rule:** If Validate is skipped, PSB risk rises even when output quality is high.   
### Phase 3 — Workflow Design & Delegation   
**Function:** convert clarity into an owned plan that respects Judgment–Expertise boundary.   
**Operations**   
- Rewrite the goal with Phase 2 clarity.   
- Break into 2–7 steps.   
- Assign ownership per step: Human-only / Human+AI / AI-assist.   
   
**Network rationale (hypothesized)**   
- Consolidates FPN executive control (planning + boundaries).   
- Protects Axis A (DTO stance) by formalizing authorship.   
- Calibrates Sₜ to difficulty without violating non-delegables.   
   
### Phase 4 — Alignment Maintenance   
**Function:** keep the work aligned to the original challenge gap and embodied knowing as it unfolds.   
**Operations**   
- Periodic check-ins: “Where are we vs goal/constraints/stakes?”   
- Embodied verification at uptake points: spacious vs tight; enlivened vs dead.   
- If off: Phase 2 mini-loop (ERV) **before** accepting/committing.   
- If tightness persists / depletion rises: **Touch Grass Protocol** (stop; recover Sₑ).   
- **Journal inscription (EAW completion):** when a genuine shift occurs, write it in your words. Transcript is not enough.   
- Ownership Alarms → fire **4Ps**; then re-Validate.   
- Time-delayed re-entry (Possess completion test).   
   
**Network rationale (hypothesized)**   
- Maintains As-If Body Loop access (embodied verification remains online).   
- Prevents drift to antagonistic/threat mode by responding to depletion early.   
- Converts transient coordination into durable α-elements via inscription.

|          **Category Error** |            DTO discipline + active rejection + non-delegables |                1–3 |
|    **Cognitive Dependency** |           prevents both Axis A & Axis B failures concurrently |                all |
|        **Delegation drift** |            ownership assignment (Judgment–Expertise boundary) |                  3 |
| **Transcript substitution** |                       Journal inscription as completion event |                  4 |
|             **Sₑ collapse** |             stop/withdrawal (Touch Grass) before forcing work | 4 (and gated by 1) |

- Escalates via → [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md) (when Sₑ depletes)   
- Scaffolded by → [Cognitive Mirror](cognitive-mirror-protege-mode.md) (Zone B)   
   
## Notes    
- **Phase 2 initiates** metabolic work during dialogue (articulation + verification; Channel 1 ↔ Channel 2 coupling begins).   
- **Phase 4 completes** EAW via inscription, producing **durable, re-enterable α-elements** across Time.
**Transcript is not enough; Journal inscription is the completion event.**
