# Reflective Prompting   
Reflective Prompting (RP) is a structured prompting protocol that uses [AI](ai.md) as a reflective surface rather than a substitute thinker. RP keeps alpha-function capacity with the human, organizes [technical scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) (Sₜ) so it amplifies rather than replaces metabolic work, and prevents premature collapse of the experienced challenge inside the [ZPD](zpd.md) by slowing work into recursive reflective loops (while the structural Challenge Gap remains pre-existing).   
Its purpose is to prevent [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), preserve authorship, and owned[ alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md) by routing insights through verification (RPVL) and completing [Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW)](enacted-alpha-work-eaw.md) via [Journal](journal.md) inscription (the transcript is not enough) when work carries [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) (can be used for work also).   
### System Role   
- Converts AI interaction from consumption into co-articulation under verification.   
- Preserves the conditions for [Productive Epistemic Tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md) (with adequate scaffolding and [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)), keeping the human stretched and metabolically engaged—so transformation can occur instead of instant pseudo-clarity.   
- Ensures AI remains a Piagetian Tool (Object) serving the human container, not a pseudo-[MKO](mko-more-knowledgeable-other.md) performing the work for the user.   
- Provides the session-level protocol within which metabolic processing begins during dialogue and becomes durable through inscription—i.e., the protocol across which EAW is initiated and completed.   
   
### Scope & Preconditions   
### Use Reflective Prompting when   
- The task has identity or developmental stakes (writing, life/role decisions, strategic thinking, deep self-understanding, complex design).   
- The goal includes growth of [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) over time, not only “get it done.”   
- Emotional Scaffolding is sufficiently stable to tolerate tension.   
- AI is available; Journal is required when the outcome must become durable (decisions, reframes, Selected Facts, identity-level shifts).   
   
### Transactional mode (light or no RP) is acceptable when   
- Tasks are purely instrumental (booking, quick queries, boilerplate).   
- The tradeoff is consciously speed over depth.   
   
### Requires   
- [Metacognition](metacognition.md) (active monitoring + regulation in service of the goal)   
- [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md)   
- [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)   
- Mandatory verification stance (RPVL)   
   
### Four-Phase Protocol   
### Phase 1 — Preparation (“Cognitive Canvas”)   
**Function:** establish epistemic and emotional baseline before AI engagement.   
**Operations**   
- Goal articulation: what would count as a real shift?   
- Resource inventory: notes, prior Journal entries, constraints.   
- Idiom & delegation boundaries: what is non-delegable (judgment, meaning, narrative) vs delegable (enumeration, editing, code, formatting).   
   
**Cognitive role**   
- Stabilizes emotional scaffolding (holding conditions) before AI engagement.   
- Makes [D](d-difficulty.md) (difficulty/identity stakes) and current C (capacity) explicit as orientation.   
   
**Relations**   
- Supports → [Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding](idiom-aligned-scaffolding.md) (Phase 3)   
   
### Phase 2 — Reflection & Warm-Up (RRV Cycle + continuous RPVL)   
**Function:** co-construct a precise “box of meaning” before heavy outputs.   
**Implements:** [RRV Cycle](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md) with RPVL running throughout.   
**Operations (RRV)**   
1. Externalize — express raw thoughts/confusions/stakes (often via Rubber Duck Debugging).   
2. Refine — push back on AI; reject flattery/premature coherence; correct what’s flat or missing.   
3. Validate — ask for synthesis; check against felt sense and task definition; recycle if off.   
   
**Cognitive role (updated to EAW ontology)**   
- Begins metabolic processing: transforms β-material toward thinkable form through articulation plus felt-sense verification (dual-channel engagement begins here).   
- Recruits alpha-function without surrendering authorship by keeping verification and rejection active inside RRV.   
- Keeps AI in Functional Alterity (difference/resistance), not “perfect agreement” mode.   
- Prepares material for downstream inscription: what is produced here may be metabolically active, but it is not yet durable until written into the Journal.   
   
**Teaching as Verification (Protégé Effect)**   
Phase 2 can position AI as a teachable novice (distinct from [Rubber Duck Debugging](rubber-duck-debugging.md)), forcing retrieval, organization, gap detection, and contradiction exposure (conflict detection / model repair).   
### Phase 3 — Workflow Design & Delegation   
**Function:** convert clarified intention into an owned plan respecting Judgment–Expertise boundary and idiom alignment.   
**Operations**   
- Rewrite the goal using Phase 2 clarity.   
- Break into 2–7 steps.   
- Assign ownership per step:   
    - Human-only (judgment, narrative, deep interpretation)   
    - Human+AI (co-drafting, co-design, option evaluation)   
    - AI-assist (editing, refactoring, syntax, formatting)   
   
**Cognitive role**   
- Applies [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md): AI as suit, not pilot.   
- Aligns scaffolding with idiom so the system bends around the person.   
   
**Relations**   
- Operates → [Judgment–Expertise Boundary](judgment-expertise-boundary.md)   
- Implements → Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding   
- Uses → Iron Man Mentality   
   
### Phase 4 — Alignment Maintenance   
**Function:** maintain alignment to the original challenge gap (D relative to C) and embodied knowing as the task unfolds.   
**Operations**   
- Periodic AI check-ins: “summarize where we are vs goal/constraints/stakes.”   
- Checklist comparison: AI compares current direction against explicit non-delegables.   
- Embodied verification: spacious vs tight; enlivened vs dead; if off, return to a Phase 2 mini-loop.   
- **Escalation:** If tightness persists after the mini-loop (persistent grounding failure, rising arousal/depletion) → **stop /[ Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)**. Do not force adoption.   
- Journal inscription (EAW completion): when a genuine shift/decision/reframe occurs, write it in your own words. Transcript is not enough; durable inscription is the event.   
   
**Cognitive role**   
- Makes [RPVL](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) most explicit/systematic (though it runs throughout).   
- Prevents drift into fluent-but-hollow output.   
- Converts transient chat into durable substrate for recursion and Selected Fact probation.   
- Completes EAW by producing re-enterable α-elements in the Journal’s chronotope.   
   
**Relations**   
- Uses → [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) *(Note: 4Ps fires throughout RP at uptake moments; Phase 4 makes it most explicit/systematic)*   
- Sustains → RRV Cycle   
- Completes → Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW)   
- Scaffolded Mode: Cognitive Mirror (for Zone B users)   
   
### Failure Modes / Diagnostics   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) ([Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md) fluency without [Channel-1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)verification and without owned inscription)   
- Delegation drift (AI becomes pseudo-MKO; authorship collapses)   
- Transcript substitution (no durable α-elements; no EAW completion)   
   
### Notes (architectural clarification)   
Reflective Prompting is the flagship method integrating scaffolding, verification, and durable ownership.   
**Continuity claim (locked):**   
- Phase 2 initiates metabolic work during dialogue (articulation + verification; dual-channel engagement begins).   
- Phase 4 completes EAW via inscription, producing durable α-elements that persist and can be re-entered across time.   
   
This preserves the key boundary condition of EAW (“output persists as a re-enterable α-element”) without falsely locating EAW entirely in Human↔AI dialogue.
