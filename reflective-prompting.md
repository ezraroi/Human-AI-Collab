      1.3. The Novice-to-Expert Gap
      The development of metacognitive skill is a key differentiator between novices and experts. While novices tend to organize knowledge as a list of facts and slowly search for correct formulas, experts organize their knowledge around core …

# Reflective Prompting   
A structured prompting protocol that uses AI as a **reflective surface** rather than a substitute thinker. Reflective Prompting keeps **[alpha-function](alpha-function.md)** with the human, organizes **[technical scaffolding ](s_t-technical-scaffolding.md)(Sₜ)** so it amplifies rather than replaces human metabolism, and preserves a productive **\|D–C\| [gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md)** by slowing work into recursive reflective loops. Its purpose is to prevent **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** and **[Cognitive Debt](cognitive-debt_e.md)** while feeding the [Journal](journal.md) with metabolized, owned insights (Journal relevant only in [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) work).   
### System Role   
- Converts AI interaction from **consumption** to **co-articulation**.   
- Maintains [Productive Epistemic Tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md)** ** so transformation can occur instead of instant pseudo-clarity.   
- Ensures AI remains a **Piagetian Tool (Object)** serving the human container, rather than a pseudo-MKO doing the alpha-function for the user.   
- Provides the **session-level protocol** that operates inside the [Recursive–Refine–Validate Cycle](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md).   
   
### Scope & Preconditions   
**Use Reflective Prompting when:**   
- The task has **identity or developmental stakes** (writing, life/role decisions, strategic thinking, deep self-understanding, complex design).   
- The goal includes **growth of [Capacity (C)](c-capacity.md) over Time**, not just “get it done.”   
- The [Journal](journal.md) and [AI](ai.md) are available and [Sₑ](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) is sufficiently stable to tolerate tension.   
   
**Transactional Mode (light or no RP) is acceptable when:**   
- Tasks are **purely instrumental** (booking, quick queries, boilerplate).   
- The conscious tradeoff is **speed over depth**, and transformation is not the aim.   
   
**Requires:**   
- [MetaCognition](metacognition.md).   
- [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md).   
   
## Four-Phase Protocol   
### Phase 1 – Preparation (“Cognitive Canvas”)   
**Function:** Establish the epistemic and emotional baseline before AI engagement.   
**Operations:**   
- **Goal articulation** – What am I actually trying to do? What would count as a real shift?   
- **Resource inventory** – Gather notes, past Journal entries, prior documents, constraints.   
- **Strengths & delegation boundaries** – Clarify: What do *I* own (judgment, meaning, narrative)? What can be delegated to AI (enumeration, editing, code, formatting)?   
   
**Cognitive role:**   
- Builds a **holding environment** before asking AI anything.   
- Makes the initial **[D (Difficulty)](d-difficulty.md)** and current **C (Capacity)** explicit.   
   
**Relations:**   
- Supports → [Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding](idiom-aligned-scaffolding.md) (later in Phase 3).   
   
### Phase 2 – Reflection & Warm-Up ([RRV Cycle](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md))   
**Function:** Co-construct a shared, precise “box of meaning” through **iterative reflection** before asking for heavy outputs.   
**Operations (implemented by RRV Cycle):**   
1. **Externalize** – Speak/write raw thoughts, confusions, stakes to AI ([Rubber Duck Debugging](rubber-duck-debugging.md)).   
2. **Refine** – Respond critically to AI’s reflection: correct, push back, reject flattery and premature coherence.   
3. **Validate** – Ask AI to summarize “what we’re doing” and check it against felt sense and task definition.   
   
**Cognitive role:**   
- Activates **[External Alpha-Function](external-alpha-function.md)** without surrendering authorship.   
- Begins transforming [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) into thinkable form.   
- Keeps AI in **[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)** (difference, resistance), not in “perfect agreement” mode.   
   
### Phase 3 – Workflow Design & Delegation   
**Function:** Turn clarified intention into an owned plan that respects the **[Judgment–Expertise Boundary](judgment-expertise-boundary.md)** and **[Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding](idiom-aligned-scaffolding.md)**.   
**Operations:**   
- **Rewrite the goal** using what Phase 2 clarified (“Given all this, the concrete outcome is…”).   
- **Break into steps** (2–7 steps) that will lead there.   
- **Assign ownership per step**:   
    - Human-only (judgment, narrative, deep interpretation)   
    - Human+AI (co-drafting, co-design, option evaluation)   
    - AI-assist (editing, refactoring, syntax, formatting)   
   
**Cognitive role:**   
- Operationalizes the **[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)**: AI as suit, not pilot.   
- Aligns scaffolding with your **idiom** so the system bends around you, not vice versa.   
   
**Relations:**   
- Operates → [Judgment–Expertise Boundary](judgment-expertise-boundary.md).   
- Implements → [Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding](idiom-aligned-scaffolding.md).   
- Uses → [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md).   
   
### Phase 4 – Alignment Maintenance   
**Function:** Maintain alignment between the work, the original D/C field, and embodied knowing as the task unfolds.   
**Operations:**   
- **Periodic AI check-ins** – “Summarize where we are relative to the original goal / constraints / stakes.”   
- **Checklist comparison** – Have AI compare the current direction against a short, explicit checklist you defined (goals, non-delegables, constraints).   
- **Embodied verification** – Track somatic signals (spacious vs tight, enlivened vs dead). If off, pause and return to Phase 2 mini-loop.   
- **Journal inscription** – When a genuine shift, decision, or reframe occurs, write it to the Journal in your own words. The transcript is not enough; the *inscribed insight* is the event.   
   
**Cognitive role:**   
- This phase is the **operational face** of the [RRV Cycle](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md).   
- Prevents drift into fluent-but-hollow output.   
- Converts transient chat into durable evidence of transformation.   
   
**Relations:**   
- Uses → [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) (especially Pause & Possess).   
- Sustains → [RRV](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md)   
   
### Failure Modes / Diagnostics   
- **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)**   
   
   
**Notes:** The flagship method integrating scaffolding, metabolism, and verification.
