# Analytic Generalization   
The claim that findings from a single case (N=1) generalize to **theoretical propositions** rather than to a statistical population.
This is the "Legal Defense" of the system. It asserts that we are not claiming "this works for everyone," but rather, "we have isolated the gears of a specific mechanism".   
**The Distinction:**   
- **Statistical Generalization:** Infers frequency (How many people will this happen to?). We do ***not** claim this.*   
- **Analytic Generalization:** Infers mechanism (Does the theory explain the process?). We ***do** claim this.*   
   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md)** (Relation: `Supported By`).   
- Link to **[P(alpha)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md)** (Relation: `Validates Mechanism Of`).
