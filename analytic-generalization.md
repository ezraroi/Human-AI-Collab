# Analytic Generalization   
The claim that findings from a single case (N=1) generalize to **theoretical propositions** rather than to a **statistical population**. This is the epistemic "legal defense" of the work: we are not claiming "this works for everyone," but rather, "this case supports a plausible account of how a specific mechanism operates under specified conditions."   
Analytic Generalization here explicitly includes the constraint that the mechanism operates only under:   
- **[Activation Pathway](activation-pathway-of-destiny-drive.md)** requirements (developmental/readiness conditions), and   
- **[Field Viability](field-viability-schema.md)** constraints (S\_e ⊗ S\_t calibrated to mismatch(D, C))   
   
—not that it is broadly activable without them. This prevents AG from being misused as rhetorical bypass of the accessibility question (see Research Gap: [Cognitive Style Bias](cognitive-style-bias.md)).   
### The Distinction   
- **Statistical Generalization:** Infers frequency ("How many people will this happen to?"). Not claimed.   
- **Analytic Generalization:** Infers mechanism plausibility ("Does the theory explain the process in this case, and specify conditions for similar cases?"). Claimed as provisional.   
   
### Relations   
- **Enabled By →** [HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md) (provides methodological framework for N=1 claims)   
- **Grounded By →** Structural Stability Verification ([HSCED](hsced-hermeneutic-single-case-efficacy-design.md) Mechanism 4 — cross-system testing supports invariance claims)   
- **Constrained By →** Activation Pathway, [Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md) (boundary conditions on all AG claims)   
- **Distinct From →** Statistical Generalization (explicitly different epistemic claim type)   
- **Claimed For →** [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) architecture (the specific theoretical contribution)   
   
### Notes   
AG supports analytic generalization to theory, not population inference, effect sizes, or universal applicability. Multi-case replication is required for broader generalizability claims.
