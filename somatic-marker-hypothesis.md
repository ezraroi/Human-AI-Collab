# Somatic Marker Hypothesis   
The **Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH)**, formulated by [Antonio Damasio](antonio-damasio.md), proposes that **emotional processes guide or bias behavior**, particularly decision-making in complex or uncertain situations.   
Simply put:   
• It asserts that **rational decision-making requires emotion**.   
• **"Somatic markers"** are **feelings in the body** (such as "gut feelings," changes in heart rate, or muscle tension) that function as **indicators of the value or risk** associated with a particular scenario.   
• These markers act as an **"automated alarm signal"** or incentive, providing an emotional shorthand that helps the brain efficiently filter options and leads to more accurate and effective decision-making.   
This process can occur either through the actual physical "body loop" or through a rapid, anticipatory representation in the brain called the **"[as-if body loop](as-if-body-loop.md)"**   
Content Note: Mention that SMH is compatible with [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) as an example of how bodily signals can inform cognition, without equating the two.
