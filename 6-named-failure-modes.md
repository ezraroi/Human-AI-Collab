# 6. Named Failure Modes   
### The Safety Collapse (S\_e → 0)   
Structural pattern:   
P(α) = (0 × S\_t) / \|D-C\| = 0   
Characteristics:   
- Perfect technical guidance present   
- Person feels judged, unsafe, exposed   
- Shutdown, defensive, cannot engage   
- All scaffolding nullified   
   
Examples:   
- Brilliant teacher, shaming environment   
- Expert coach, no psychological safety   
- Technical mentor, judgmental tone   
   
Intervention: Rebuild trust before adding technique   
### The Challenge Void (\|D-C\| → 0)   
Structural pattern:   
P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / 0 = undefined/zero   
Characteristics:   
- Perfect safety and guidance   
- No challenge, no growth zone   
- Comfortable but stagnant   
- Alpha-function never activates   
   
Examples:   
- Protein Shake Brain (AI removes all difficulty)   
- Micromanager (does work for team)   
- Helicopter parent (prevents all struggle)   
   
Intervention: Reintroduce appropriate challenge   
### The Overwhelm (\|D-C\| >> S)   
Structural pattern:   
P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / HUGE = ≈0   
Characteristics:   
- Good safety and guidance present   
- Challenge far exceeds capacity + support   
- Anxiety, panic, cognitive overload   
- System cannot bridge the gap   
   
Examples:   
- Calculus to 5th grader   
- Leadership role to junior employee   
- Complex trauma work too soon   
   
Intervention: Reduce gap (simpler task) or massively increase scaffolding   
### The Technical Void (S\_t → 0)   
Structural pattern:   
P(α) = (S\_e × 0) / \|D-C\| = 0   
Characteristics:   
- Excellent safety and trust   
- No guidance, structure, or direction   
- Person is lost despite feeling safe   
- Support without substance   
   
Examples:   
- Warm but ineffective therapy   
- Friendly but passive mentorship   
- Supportive but unstructured leadership   
   
Intervention: Add appropriate technical scaffolding   
### The Compound Failure (Multiple Components)   
Structural pattern:   
P(α) = (0 × 0) / HUGE = 0   
Characteristics:   
- Multiple components simultaneously failed   
- No safety, no guidance, wrong challenge   
- System comprehensively broken   
   
Examples:   
- Toxic workplace (no S\_e, bad S\_t, wrong challenges)   
- Traumatic experience without support   
- Default AI use creating PSB   
   
Intervention: Systematic rebuild starting with S\_e
