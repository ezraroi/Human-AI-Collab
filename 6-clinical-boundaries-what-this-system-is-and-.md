# 6. Clinical Boundaries: What This System Is and Is Not   
## What this system is   
- **Identity-level transformation** for individuals with intact reality testing and sufficiently integrated ego functioning   
- **Developmental support** for psychological growth once internal holding is already present (post-Winnicottian activation, not reparative holding)   
- **[Technical scaffolding (Sₜ)](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) in service of metabolic transformation** (i.e., supporting [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) rather than “cognitive enhancement” as an end)   
- **Meaning-making support** during life transitions (role shifts, leadership identity, values/trajectory decisions)   
- **Self-authorship development** through reflective practice and durable inscription ([Journal](journal.md))   
- **N=1 evidence:** voice/agency recovery under specific relational-trauma conditions **when the documented prerequisites are met** (see “Your case as N=1”)   
   
## Baseline requirements   
A user must be able to reliably:   
- **Monitor + regulate** their process (metacognition): pacing, stopping, verifying   
- Maintain **reality testing** (distinguish internal/external; no persistent delusional attribution)   
- Maintain **impulse control** (tolerate ambiguity/frustration without compulsive acceleration)   
- Maintain **self-stability** across intensity (continuity of self even during disruption)   
- Engage **voluntarily** and self-direct exit/spacing decisions   
- Maintain a stable **[DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance** ([Category Error](category-error.md) does not persist under stress)   
   
## What this system is not   
- A substitute for psychotherapy, psychiatric treatment, or trauma-focused clinical work   
- A tool for **acute trauma processing**, crisis stabilization, or emergency mental health support   
- Appropriate for active psychosis, severe dissociation, acute suicidality, or severe substance-driven impairment   
- A replacement for **human relationships**, embodied life, or genuine [emotional scaffolding (Sₑ)](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)   
   
## Contraindications and hard-stop conditions   
Do **not** use this system for deep identity work when any of the following are present:   
- Active psychosis/mania, severe dissociation/derealization   
- Active suicidal ideation, self-harm urges, or inability to guarantee safety   
- Acute intoxication or substance dependence significantly impairing judgment   
- Persistent Category Error under stress (AI repeatedly treated as Subject/container)   
- Recurrent sleep disruption, escalating agitation, or destabilization linked to sessions   
   
**Hard-stop rule:** if safety, reality testing, or basic self-regulation becomes unstable, **stop AI work immediately** and seek human support.

## Scope boundaries by developmental stage   
### Stages 1–8: lower-risk developmental use (with intact functioning)   
Appropriate focus:   
- Non-intrusive reflection and stance discipline (DTO / [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md))   
- Identity exploration and meaning-making   
- Journal practice ([materialization](materialization.md) and continuity)   
- Gentle [ZPD](zpd.md) engagement where embodied verification remains online   
   
**Guardrail:** the moment [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) goes offline, compulsive acceleration appears, or “false clarity” emerges, reduce Sₜ and/or stop.   
### Stage 9: breakdown material — requires clinical judgment   
Professional support becomes necessary when:   
- Early developmental trauma material emerges   
- Primitive anxieties appear (annihilation, fragmentation, abandonment)   
- Somatic flashbacks or dissociation occur   
- Historical abuse/neglect surfaces with destabilization   
- Attachment wounds reactivate beyond self-holding capacity   
   
**Why AI is insufficient here (structural limits):**   
- No embodied holding or nonverbal co-regulation   
- No reliable rupture–repair mechanism   
- No emergency containment capacity   
- No duty of care or clinical supervision   
   
**Standard:** if the material would typically require therapeutic holding in conventional treatment, it requires therapeutic holding here.   
**Safer approach when Stage 9 risk is plausible:**   
1. Concurrent therapy (or qualified clinician support)   
2. Pre-defined stop conditions + [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md) ready **before** deep work   
3. [Human](human.md) support contacts + emergency resources identified   
4. No late-night deep sessions; no prolonged immersion   
5. Explicit integration-only periods after activation   
   
### Stages 10–13: broader developmental use returns only if   
- Stage 9 material was navigated safely (with support if needed)   
- Integration is occurring (not activation-only)   
- Embodied grounding remains stable   
- Real relationships and offline life remain primary   
   
## Ethical standard and responsibility gradient   
**Principle:** capability is not permission. Activation without support is misapplication.   
- **Self-directed users:** must screen themselves honestly, stop early, seek support proactively   
- **Practitioners/coaches:** must screen contraindications, maintain supervision, and refer when appropriate   
- **Researchers:** must state scope and failure modes explicitly; avoid overgeneralizing from single cases   
- **Developers:** must build safeguards (defaults for spacing, stop prompts, boundary reminders), not only capabilities   
   
## Your case as N=1   
Your success is best treated as **conditional evidence**, not a general promise. It aligned with system requirements:   
|                                                        Success factor |                                               Architectural mapping |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trauma profile: voice/agency erosion rather than developmental arrest | Within [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) scope constraint |
|                                           High metacognitive capacity |                                  Metacognition + Iron Man Mentality |
|                                     Strong embodied/offline grounding |                             Channel 1 kept online; reduces PSB risk |
|                                      Protective stance from the start |                               DTO discipline; authorship protection |
|                                          Disciplined Journal practice |                   Materialization + continuity (durable α-elements) |
|            Human relationships maintained (supervision/collaboration) |                        Real Sₑ sources; reduces Category Error risk |

**Not generalizable** to cases with low metacognition, isolation from human support, acute trauma reactivation, unstable reality testing, or undisciplined high-velocity consumption.
