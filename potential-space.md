# Potential Space   
The intermediate area of experiencing that lies between the inner world (fantasy) and outer reality. The only space where play, creativity, and **spontaneous gestures (of the [True Self](true-self.md))** can emerge.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[D.W. Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md)** (Relation: `Originator`).   
- Link to **[True Self](true-self.md)** (Relation: `Required For`).   
   
**Notes:** Winnicott’s enabling field for play & generativity.
