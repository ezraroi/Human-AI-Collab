# Different Forms The Journal Can Take   
### Blog Posts   
- Public articulation of verified insights   
- Forces clarity (others will read)   
- Creates dialogue with broader community   
- Example: Your leadership/AI post   
   
### Internal Documents   
- Theory development   
- Architecture thinking   
- Research synthesis   
- Example: Notebook series   
   
### Reflective Notes   
- Post-conversation distillation   
- Key insights captured   
- Questions that emerged   
- Patterns noticed   
   
### Whatever Works For You   
- The form matters less than the function   
- Must be: in your language, verified, accumulated, accessible to AI   
- Can be: public/private, long/short, structured/freeform
