# 1. Executive Summary   
Notebook 6 asks: "What are the precise mechanisms by which [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) enhances [metacognition](metacognition.md)?"   
The research confirms that [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) is not just a conversation technique; it is a structured Cognitive Repair Protocol. It systematically activates Metacognitive Monitoring (seeing your thoughts) and Metacognitive Control (fixing your thoughts) by leveraging the unique affordances of [AI](ai.md) as a [Dynamic Transitional Object](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md).
