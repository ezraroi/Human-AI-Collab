# 1. Executive Summary   
Notebook 6 asks: "What are the precise mechanisms by which [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) enhances [metacognition](metacognition.md)?"   
The research confirms that [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) is not just a conversation technique; It systematically supports [Metacognitive](metacognition.md) Monitoring (seeing your thoughts) and Metacognitive Control (fixing your thoughts) by using AI as a [Dynamic Transitional Object](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md)—an event-like, verification-requiring artifact that provides catalytic difference without doing the thinking for the user.
