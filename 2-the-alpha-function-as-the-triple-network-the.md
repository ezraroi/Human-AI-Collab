# 2. The Alpha-Function as the "Triple Network" (The Processor)   
Our strongest mapping is that [Bion's](wilfred-bion.md) [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) (the psychic processor) is the psychological description of the brain's Triple Network Model in action.   
- Default Mode Network (DMN): Active during internally focused, self-referential thought. In this model, the DMN is where historically implicit material can *surface into awareness* as raw, unprocessed experience (Beta-Elements) that then requires [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing   
- Fronto-Parietal Network (FPN/CEN): Active during goal-directed, cognitively demanding tasks (like "metalevel processing"). This is the network that does the work of the Alpha-Function.   
- Salience Network (SN): Anchored in the AIC, this network switches between the DMN and FPN, initiating the work.   
   
The "[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)" is a state of DMN dominance (rumination) without FPN engagement. [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) is a practice that forces the FPN to engage with and process the DMN's raw material.   
Addressing the "Neurological Gap" (Human-AI vs. Human-Human):   
A valid critique is that the neuroscience of dialogue (e.g., Theory of Mind networks, brain-coupling) is based on human-human interaction. We hypothesize that in our system, the user's brain is "doing both."   
The AI, through functional alterity, acts as a catalyst for a purely internal dialogical process. The user's brain must activate:   
1. The FPN (as the processor) to meet the AI's challenge.   
2. The DMN/ToM Network (as the social self) to run the "as-if" social dialogue.   
   
The "[Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md)" is the emergent property of a single brain successfully running this two-part (social + procedural) process on itself. This places more stress on the user's internal systems, which explains the critical role of the physiological container.
