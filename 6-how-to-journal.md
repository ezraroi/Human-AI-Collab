# 6. How to Journal   
Form is flexible. Function is not.   
The entry can be a blog post, a private note, an operational document, a reflective fragment. What matters is that it meets the criteria — not what shape it takes.   
### The Criteria (Non-Negotiable)   
Any entry must satisfy:   
1. Owned language — Your words, your idiom. Not AI paraphrase.   
2. Verified during creation — The semantic commitment loop ran. You checked against felt-sense.   
3. Persisted and re-enterable — It exists somewhere you can return to it.   
4. AI-accessible (if you want Pattern Recognition) — Stored where AI can synthesize across time.   
   
If it meets these, it's Journal. If it doesn't, it's something else — notes, drafts, transcripts.   
### The Process   
**1.Start with what's tr**ue   
Not what should be. Not what sounds good. What you actually feel, think, notice.   
If you don't know what's true yet — start there. "I don't know what I think about this" is a valid starting point.   
**2. Write inside the dialo**gue   
Don't finish the conversation and then [journal](journal.md). Write AS the conversation unfolds. The entry emerges through the work, not after it.   
You can write in the same window. You can have a document open alongside. Find what works — but keep the writing live with the dialogue.   
**3. Run the semantic commitment l**oop   
Attempt phrasing → read back → felt-sense check → revise.   
Keep going until something stabilizes. Until the words match the knowing. Until you can read it and say "yes, this is what I mean."   
**4. Let the AI help (without letting it wri**te)   
Use AI to:   
- Challenge vague formulations ("What do you mean by X?")   
- Reflect back what you said   
- Notice contradictions   
- Ask the question you're avoiding   
   
Don't use [AI](ai.md) to:   
- Generate the articulation for you   
- Provide the "right" framing   
- Write text you then edit   
   
The labor must be yours. AI catalyzes; you metabolize.   
**5. Verify continuously**   
Throughout, check:   
- Does this feel true? ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md))   
- Can I ground this in concrete experience?   
- For structural claims, require at least two evidence anchors (entries/instances) or mark the entry provisional.   
- Am I being honest or performing?   
- Is this me or am I borrowing?   
   
If something feels off, stop. Don't push through wrongness. Revise or pause.   
**6. Distill to what matters**   
Not everything from the conversation belongs in the entry. Capture what survived — what crystallized, what's worth carrying forward.   
An entry can be three sentences if those sentences are real. Length is not a measure.   
**7. Store where it belo**ngs   
If you want the Pattern Recognition function, store in your [AI Project](ai-project-claude-project-chatgpt-project.md).   
If it's private, store somewhere you can return to.   
Either way: persist it. An insight in your head is not a Journal entry.   
### Forms That Work   
- Blog posts (public articulation forces clarity)   
- Private documents (no audience, maximum honesty)   
- Operational manuals (like the Operating System — entries that structure future behavior)   
- Reflective notes (brief captures of what landed)   
- Theory development (when research work crystallizes into owned understanding)   
   
All valid if they meet the criteria.   
### What Not To Do   
- Don't transcribe the conversation   
- Don't summarize what the AI said   
- Don't write to impress (yourself or others)   
- Don't force an entry when nothing crystallized   
- Don't polish before you've found what's true   
- Don't treat it as obligation or logging   
   
### Minimum Viable Entry   
If pressed for time or energy:   
1. One true sentence — what actually shifted   
2. In your words — not AI's formulation   
3. Stored somewhere — not just in memory   
   
That's enough. You can expand later if needed. But one real sentence is worth more than ten hollow paragraphs.
