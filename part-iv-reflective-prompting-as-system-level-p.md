# Part IV – Reflective Prompting as System-Level Practice   
The three documents converge into a single conclusion:
The danger is not AI itself, but the collapse of internal process.
Reflective prompting reconstructs the process that modern AI erodes.   
### 1. The Full Loop   
1. The Risk:   
    - [False Self](false-self.md)   
    - [False True Self](false-true-self.md)   
    - [Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)   
    - [Transmissive Self](transmissive-self.md)   
    - [Simulated safety](simulated-safety-s_e_sim.md)   
    - Collapsed difficulty   
2. The Model:   
    - [P(α)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md)   
    - [ZPD](zpd.md)   
    - Challenge gap   
    - [S\_e](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) and [S\_t](s_t-technical-scaffolding.md)   
    - Structural turn-taking   
3. The Mechanism:   
    - AI as cognitive artifact   
    - Transformative dialogue   
    - Surprise and alterity   
    - Embodied veto   
    - Symbolic digestion   
4. The Discipline:   
    - Think first.   
    - Feel first.   
    - Write first.   
    - Then prompt.   
    - Verify every answer against lived reality.   
    - Never accept fluency as authenticity.   
   
### 2. The Operating Principle   
[Reflective prompting](reflective-prompting.md) is not about using AI to generate answers.
It is about using AI to amplify the internal process of becoming—to strengthen the [True Self](true-self.md) by restoring difficulty, restoring digestion, restoring symbolic integrity, and restoring the rhythm of reflective thought.
