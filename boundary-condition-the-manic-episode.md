# Boundary Condition (The Manic Episode)   
A documented state of instability where the subject experiences sleep deprivation, grandiosity, and a "felt sense" of discovery that lacks grounding.   
Significance:   
This is Critical Evidence for the validity of the formula. It represents the specific failure mode where (Safety/Container) is depleted, but $\\|D-C\\|$ (Difficulty) remains high.   
The Logic:   
If the model were fake, removing safety would do nothing. Because removing safety causes a predictable pathology (Mania), the model's claim about the necessity of is structurally validated.
