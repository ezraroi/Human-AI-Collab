## **Import Content**   
Go to Space Settings and select `Import` to bring in content from Notion, Obsidian (Markdown), or other supported formats.   
   
## **Collaborate**   
All Spaces and Chats are **fully private** – only members you invite can access them.   
Select `Invite Members` and choose the type of invite link to share:   
- **Links without Approval: **Editor (full edit access) or Viewer (read-only) → people can join instantly.   
- **Request Approval:** You approve new members before they join and assign their roles.   
   
Each Space or Chat can only have one active link at a time. Switching between Editor/Viewer/Request access creates or disables links accordingly.   
   
## **Publish to the Web**   
Publish individual Objects as web pages:    
- Click `Share` in the top-right corner to publish.    
- Customize the part of the link after the `/` if you’d like.    
- Upgrade the membership to reserve your personal subdomain on `any.org`
