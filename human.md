# Human   
**Role:** The Architect.   
**Definition:** "Holds the **Non-Myopic Awareness** (Global Goal). Because the AI is myopic (predicting the next token), the Human must provide the teleology and detect 'Teleological Drift' ."   
Provides   
- Agency and intentionality   
- Embodied experience (though currently under-theorized)   
- The subject whose C actually grows   
   
**Notes:** The *role* “Human as Architect / Container” is a structural constant in the model; their **C** is cumulative, but the **component object** is a static role definition and part of the support architecture.
