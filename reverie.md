# Reverie   
The term "**reverie**" refers to a state of mind, primarily of the mother or analyst ([the container](the-container.md)), that is essential for processing emotional experiences.   
Simply and shortly, reverie is:   
1. A state of **acute and receptive observation** or **preconscious dreamlike thinking**.   
2. The **capacity** of the container to **receive, metabolize, and transform** the infant's (or patient's) intolerable feelings ([beta-elements](beta-elements.md)) into a digestible, meaningful form ([alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)).   
3. A condition where the mind is **open and receptive** and attempts to be **free of personal memory and desire** in order to focus on the immediate, emotional truth (O) of the session   
   
Connections to [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) :   
• **Mechanism of Transformation:** The caregiver (container) transforms the infant's intolerable feelings, or raw, mentally undigested emotional facts (**beta-elements**), into meaningful, digestible forms (**alpha-elements**). This successful detoxification and transformation is achieved by the container using its **alpha-function** while in a state of **reverie**.   
• **Analytic Practice:** In the analytic setting, the "analytic attitude" that [Bion](wilfred-bion.md) recommends, the state of **reverie**, allows the **[alpha-function](alpha-function.md)** (the receptive capacity of the analyst) to stimulate the patient's process of thinking and dreaming. The analyst's alpha-function, working in reverie, allows the analyst to introspectively access and summon emotions that resonate with the analysand's hidden emotional truths, thereby achieving a "common sense" corroboration of the patient's feelings and establishing the "clinical truth" of the moment.   
• **Source of Thinking:** The mother, in a state of **reverie**, uses her **alpha-function** to contain, mediate, and translate the infant's overwhelming emotions into personal truths, which Bion suggests is the origin of thinking. Alpha-function is also described as transforming sense-impressions of an emotional experience into alpha-elements, whether one is sleeping or waking, allowing the subject to "dream the session".   
**Notes:** Container’s receptive mode enabling alpha-function processing.
