# Systems Consolidation   
The process during NREM sleep where the Hippocampus "replays" insights to the Neocortex, making them permanent.   
This provides a biological mechanism that supports durability across [time](time.md); the [Journal](journal.md) provides re-enterable substrate ([Chronotope](chronotope.md)), and Time (including sleep) supports stabilization of metabolized content.   
**Notes: **Neural mechanism supporting long-term stabilization over time; aligns with Journal ↔ Time as substrate + temporal support.
