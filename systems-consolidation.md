# Systems Consolidation   
The process during NREM sleep where the Hippocampus "replays" insights to the Neocortex, supporting longer-term stabilization.   
This provides a biological mechanism that supports durability across time; the [Journal](journal.md) provides re-enterable substrate ([Chronotope](chronotope.md): **[diachronic alterity](diachronic-alterity.md) / addressable past-self I-position**), and Time (including sleep) supports stabilization of **metabolized + materialized** content (not a substitute for Journal inscription when identity stakes / durable accumulation are in scope).   
**Notes: **Neural mechanism supporting long-term stabilization over time; aligns with Journal ↔ Time as substrate + temporal support.
