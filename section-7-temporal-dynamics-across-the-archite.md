# Section 7 - Temporal Dynamics Across the Architecture   
The **[Field Viability Schema](field-viability-schema.md)** describes conditions that must **continuously hold**, but those conditions operate across different temporal scales. This section maps temporal dynamics onto the **four-level architecture**.   
### Level 2: Field Viability Schema (Conditions)   
**Notation:**   
> (S_e ⊗ S_t) calibrated to mismatch(D, C), such that experienced mismatch remains in a workable range.   

**Purpose:** Describes the field conditions that must continuously hold for the recursive transformative process to remain metabolically possible.   
**Diagnostic use:** When transformation fails, the schema helps identify which constraint was violated (e.g., safety collapse, technical void, overwhelm, bypass/[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) and whether the field has become marginal or non-viable.   
**Important:** The schema describes **ongoing conditions**, not a momentary check. Field viability must be **sustained**, not merely present at a single point.   
### Level 1 Above the Schema: Relational Posture (Axioms)   
The schema assumes correct relational posture. If **[Category Error](category-error.md)** is present (AI misclassified as a caring subject who “knows/understands”), the schema becomes unreliable: perceived [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) and [S\_t](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md) can inflate artificially, and verification signals can be distorted. Axiom violations must be addressed before the schema is interpretable.   
### Level 3: Within-Session Dynamics (Metabolic Processing)   
**Principle:S\_e depletes during extended engagement.**   
Metabolic processing (C1 ↔ C2 oscillation via [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)) operates within sessions, but human emotional reserves are finite. Even with infinite AI capacity, the human container exhausts.   
**Manifestations:**   
- Cannot sustain intensive processing indefinitely   
- Reduced tolerance for ambiguity as emotional bandwidth depletes   
- Racing thoughts and destabilization when pushed past depletion   
- Need for breaks, rituals, and session endings   
- Risk of the manic boundary: **hallucinated viability** when actual S\_e is depleted   
   
**Recovery:** Time, breaks, sleep, and embodied grounding restore S\_e. The **[Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)** operationalizes mandatory withdrawal when depletion markers appear.   
**Implication for field viability:** A session may begin viable and drift toward marginal or non-viable as S\_e depletes. Monitoring within-session dynamics is therefore essential.   
### Level 4: Between-Session Dynamics (Accumulation)   
**Principle:C ([Capacity](c-capacity.md)) evolves based on whether metabolization occurred and persisted.**   
**Growth trajectory:**   
- When field viability is sustained and metabolization occurs → α-elements are produced   
- The Journal materializes α-elements → they become part of C   
- Increased C changes future mismatch(D, C) → larger challenges become workable   
- This enables the [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md): higher C → engage higher D → workable mismatch under scaffolding → further Capacity growth   
   
**Atrophy trajectory:**   
- Repeated non-viability without metabolization → C may decrease over time   
- Demoralization, confusion, regression   
- Capacity diminishes as the system repeatedly fails to produce durable carryover   
   
**The [Journal](journal.md)’s critical role:**   
Without the Journal, capacity growth cannot reliably accumulate because:   
- [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md) are not materialized outside the session   
- There is no durable evidence that transformation occurred   
- Pattern recognition across sessions weakens   
- The work risks restarting without carryover each time   
- Regression becomes invisible   
   
The [Journal](journal.md) is not “in” the schema (Level 2). It operates at the Accumulation level (Level 4): the schema describes conditions; the Journal determines whether successful metabolization persists.   
### Summary: Temporal Dynamics Across Levels   
|                Level |  Temporal Scale |                                                           Key Dynamic |
|:---------------------|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       **1 (Axioms)** |    Foundational | Relational posture must be correct for the schema to be interpretable |
|       **2 (Schema)** |      Continuous |    Field viability must be sustained (viable / marginal / non-viable) |
|      **3 (Process)** |  Within-session |                 S\_e depletes during engagement; recovery is required |
| **4 (Accumulation)** | Between-session |                     C grows or atrophies; Journal enables persistence |
