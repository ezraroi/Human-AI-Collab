# Mikhail Bakhtin   
Provides the **Time-Space Context**.
***[Chronotope](chronotope.md):** The stable time-space provided by the **[Journal](journal.md)**.
*[Internally Persuasive Discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md): **A desired form of discourse within the system—internalized through genuine understanding and ownership and verified by [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) ([Felt Shift](felt-shift.md))—in contrast to [Authoritative Discourse](authoritative-discourse.md).**
Alterity: The "otherness" required for dialogue, addressed functionally by the AI’s turn-by-turn "[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)" (productive difference without conscious otherness).   
Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) was a Russian philosopher, literary critic, and scholar who became one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century in literary theory, ethics, and the philosophy of language. His work emphasizes that all language and meaning are social and produced through dynamic interaction, not static systems.   
Key Contributions and Concepts   
- **Dialogism:** This central concept argues that all discourse is fundamentally an ongoing, responsive exchange, where meaning is generated only through the interaction of different voices and contexts, not in isolation. "To be means to be for another, and through the other for oneself".   
- **Polyphony:** Inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels, this term refers to the coexistence of multiple, independent, and "fully valid" voices or consciousnesses within a text, which interact without being subordinated to a single authorial voice. This opposes "monologic" thinking, which enforces a single, authoritative truth.   
- **Carnivalesque:** In his book *Rabelais and His World*, Bakhtin describes how the medieval carnival tradition subverts official culture and social hierarchies through humor, parody, and chaos. This concept represents a temporary liberation from dominant norms and an openness to change and new possibilities.   
- **Heteroglossia:** This describes the natural diversity of speech styles, dialects, jargons, and social languages that coexist within a single language at any given time. Each form carries its own unique perspective and values, contributing to the rich, dynamic nature of language.   
- **[Chronotope](chronotope.md):** This concept analyzes how time and space are represented in literature, arguing that literary genres are structured by specific configurations of time-space that shape how characters and events unfold.   
   
Bakhtin's ideas, largely unknown until after his death due to political repression and censorship in the Soviet Union, have had a profound impact across the humanities and social sciences.
