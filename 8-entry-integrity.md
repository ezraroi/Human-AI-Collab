# 8. Entry Integrity   
Not all entries are real. Some look like [Journal](journal.md) but aren't.   
This section provides markers for distinguishing authentic materialization from pseudo-writing — and what to do when you notice the difference.   
### When It's Working   
The writing feels owned:   
- These are YOUR words, your way of putting it   
- You couldn't have copied this from anywhere   
- The phrasing carries your signature   
   
There was friction:   
- You struggled to find the right words   
- Multiple attempts, revisions, adjustments   
- The entry cost something to produce   
   
Re-reading produces recognition:   
- "Yes, this is what I meant"   
- Returning to it deepens rather than flattens   
- You can feel yourself in the text   
   
The body resonates:   
- Reading it back produces spaciousness, not tightness   
- Something settles when you see it written   
- "This is true" registers somatically   
   
Continuity emerges:   
- The entry connects to other entries   
- You can trace a thread across time   
- "This relates to what I wrote last month"   
   
Downstream change appears:   
- Something shifted after writing   
- You act differently, see differently   
- The insight has traction in lived experience   
   
### When It's Not Working   
The writing feels borrowed:   
- [AI](ai.md) language crept in   
- "This sounds smart but not like me"   
- You're not sure you could reproduce this without looking   
   
It was too easy:   
- Words flowed without friction   
- No struggle, no revision   
- Smooth production, no resistance   
   
Re-reading produces blankness:   
- "Did I write this?"   
- Dissonance or amnesia on return   
- The words don't land anymore   
   
The body is absent:   
- No felt-sense check during creation   
- Tightness ignored or overridden   
- "I should believe this" rather than "I do believe this"   
   
Entries stay isolated:   
- No connection to previous work   
- Each one sits alone   
- No accumulating arc   
   
Nothing changes:   
- Insight felt true but produced no shift   
- Same realizations appearing again months later   
- Clarity in the moment, fog afterward   
   
### The Counterfeit Patterns   
Pattern 1: Fluent capture Writing that documents AI's good formulations. Sounds coherent. Isn't owned. Test: cover the entry and try to say it in your own words. If you can't, it's borrowed.   
Pattern 2: Performative depth Writing that sounds profound but wasn't worked through. Often produced when trying to have an insight rather than following one. Test: is this for an imagined audience or for you?   
Pattern 3: Premature crystallization Writing before the material has settled. Forcing an entry when verification loops haven't converged. Test: does this feel finished or are you trying to make it finished?   
Pattern 4: Discharge writing Writing to release tension rather than metabolize it. Venting, complaining, processing-as-catharsis. Test: did this change something or just relieve pressure?   
Pattern 5: Summary mode Writing that recaps the conversation instead of capturing what survived. Transcript-adjacent. Test: would someone reading this know what the AI said? If yes, you're summarizing, not materializing.   
### What To Do When You Notice   
If the entry feels fake:   
- Don't delete it — mark it as provisional   
- Return later with fresh Sₑ   
- Ask: what's actually true here? Start from that.   
   
If you can't find owned language:   
- You're not ready to write yet   
- More dialogue needed, or more time   
- Let it stay unwritten until it's yours   
   
If re-reading produces dissonance:   
- The entry may have captured a moment, not a truth   
- Or you've grown past it   
- Either way: mark it, don't treat it as current   
   
If nothing connects:   
- You may be writing too infrequently (no continuity)   
- Or writing about scattered topics (no thread)   
- Consider: what's the arc I'm actually in?   
   
### The Integrity Check (Quick Version)   
Before calling an entry complete, ask:   
1. Is this my voice?   
2. Did I struggle to find these words?   
3. Does my body say yes?   
4. Could I return to this in three months and recognize myself?   
   
If any answer is no — you're not done. Or you're not ready.
