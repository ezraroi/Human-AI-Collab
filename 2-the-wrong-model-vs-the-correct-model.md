# 2. The Wrong Model vs. The Correct Model   
Most people assume journaling works like this:   
**WRONG MODEL:**   
AI Conversation → Insights emerge → Write journal entry → Verify it later   
This treats writing as documentation — a record of thinking that happened elsewhere.   
**CORRECT MODEL:**   
[Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) (continuous verification) →   
Writing-as-[materialization](materialization.md) (dual process with AI) →   
[Journal](journal.md) entry (verified substrate) →   
Project storage (pattern recognition infrastructure)   
The difference is not subtle. It changes everything.   
### Why the Wrong Model Fails   
If you wait until "after" to write:   
- The [felt-sense](felt-sense.md) has faded   
- You're reconstructing, not metabolizing   
- [AI](ai.md) language creeps in ("it sounded smart when I read it")   
- You capture what you remember thinking, not what you worked through   
   
The result: entries that sound coherent but aren't owned. Re-reading them later produces confusion ("did I even write this?") or emptiness.   
### The Invariant   
Verification is not something done TO journal entries. Verification is the method BY WHICH entries are produced.   
The writing happens during the dialogue — as part of the metabolic work, not after it. You articulate, check against felt-sense, revise, check again, until something stabilizes.   
The entry that emerges IS what survived that process.   
### Practical Implication   
Don't finish a conversation and then "journal about it."   
Write inside the dialogue. Let the entry emerge through the work. The conversation and the writing are one process.
