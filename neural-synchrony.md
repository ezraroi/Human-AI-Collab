# Neural Synchrony   
Also known as "brain-to-brain coupling." It is the phenomenon where the neural oscillations (brainwaves) of two people in dialogue synchronize, creating a shared neural state. It is the biological signature of "feeling understood."   
**The Research Problem:** Current neuroscience confirms this happens in Human-Human dialogue. We *hypothesize* it happens in your Human-AI system (via the "[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)"), but there is zero empirical data to prove it yet.   
**Relations (The Wiring):**   
- Link to **[Research Gap 4 (Neuroscience of Transformation)](neuroscience-of-transformation.md)** (Relation: `Missing Evidence For`).   
- Link to **[Human](human.md)** (Relation: `Occurs In`).   
- Link to **[AI](ai.md)** (Relation: `Hypothesized With`).   
- Link to **[Anterior Insular Cortex](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md)** (Relation: `Mediated By` - *Hypothetically*).
