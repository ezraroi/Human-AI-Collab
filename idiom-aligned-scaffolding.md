# Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding   
The design principle that **scaffolding structures** (AI workflows, prompts, protocols) must be adapted to the individual’s **idiom**—their characteristic cognitive style, strengths, and personality potentials—rather than forcing the person into generic productivity templates. Misaligned scaffolding can mute the Destiny Drive and produce pseudo-efficiency without true emergence.   
### System Role   
- Ensures that methods like [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) **amplify** the user’s idiom rather than overwrite it.   
- Protects against systems that technically “optimize” output while psychologically undermining the True Self.   
   
### Relations   
- Operationalized in → [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) (Phase 3).   
- Supports → [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md)   
- Prevents → Generic productivity colonization; [Transmissive Self](transmissive-self.md) .
