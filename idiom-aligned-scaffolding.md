# Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding   
The design principle that scaffolding structures ([AI](ai.md) workflows, prompts, protocols) must be adapted to the individual’s idiom—their characteristic cognitive style, strengths, and personality potentials—rather than forcing the person into generic productivity templates. Misaligned scaffolding can block idiom articulation and produce pseudo-efficiency without the phenomenological articulation of Destiny Drive.   
### Mechanism: Idiom-Preserving Structuration (Corpus-Bound)   
When a Journal corpus is available, scaffolding should constrain AI to **reveal latent structure implicit in the user’s idiom-corpus** rather than import generic frameworks. This protects authorship at the **framework level** (not only phrasing level) and prevents idiom overwrite (“colonization”) through foreign structure imposition. If no idiom corpus exists (or if it is contaminated/AI-heavy), AI will tend to default to generic structure even when prompts appear “personalized.”   
### System Role   
- Ensures that methods like Reflective Prompting amplify the user’s idiom rather than overwrite it.   
- Protects against systems that technically “optimize” output while psychologically undermining the True Self.   
- Enables non-colonizing cross-temporal synthesis by binding AI structuration to the user’s accumulated idiom-corpus (when available).   
   
### Relations   
- Operationalized in → [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) (Phase 3).   
- Supports → [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md).   
- Depends on → [Journal](journal.md) (idiom corpus integrity) (for corpus-bound structuration).   
- Helps prevent → Generic productivity colonization; [Transmissive Self](transmissive-self.md) (i.e., transmitting externally provided fluency without owned meaning).
