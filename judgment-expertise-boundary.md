# Judgment–Expertise Boundary   
The discriminative capacity to distinguish between tasks that require **judgment** (context-sensitive, value-laden, embodied decisions that cannot be delegated without loss of authorship) and tasks that primarily require **expertise** (domain knowledge and procedure that can be safely delegated to AI). Maintaining this boundary is central to safe augmentation and to preventing the erosion of internal authority.   
### System Role   
- Governs what **must remain human-led** vs. what can be automated or co-authored.   
- Protects against over-delegation to AI.   
   
### Relations   
- Operationalized in → [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md).   
- Requires → [MetaCognition](metacognition.md); [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md).   
- Supported by → [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)   
   
**Notes:** Structural boundary protecting authorship; used in RP Phase 3.
