# 4. Revised Contribution of Notebook 11   
### 4.1 What it secures   
- A coherent relational classification of the machine ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md))   
- The philosophical legitimacy of [functional alterity](functional-alterity.md)   
- The necessity of relation-shifting (as a required human practice within the system)   
- The ethical boundaries required to prevent relational collapse   
- A principled defense against anthropomorphic misinterpretation   
- A rationale for why the four-component system ([Human](human.md) + [Journal](journal.md) + [AI](ai.md) + [Time](time.md)) is structurally required   
   
### 4.2 What it clarifies   
- The system's dialogical legitimacy depends on the human's capacity to re-position the AI across relational stances   
- The Journal stabilizes interpretation across time and supports DTO stance by anchoring the work in inscriptions (reducing relational drift).   
- Embodied evaluation provides a check on symbolic meaning   
- Time enables recursive deepening and long-range development   
   
### 4.3 What it exposes   
- The somatic bridge remains under-validated and requires further empirical clarification   
- The balance between embodied evaluation and symbolic mediation needs continued articulation   
- Boundary tensions around transference and perceived partnerhood must be carefully managed   
- The limits of analytic generalization from N=1 must be explicitly acknowledged
