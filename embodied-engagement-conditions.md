# Embodied Engagement Conditions   
The three content-level prerequisites that determine whether symbolic AI output [(Channel 2)](channel-2-symbolic.md) successfully recruits embodied processing [(Channel 1)](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) rather than remaining purely abstract. These conditions specify what properties symbolic material must possess to become **metabolically active** and trigger the transformation pathway. When these conditions are met, the [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) engages; PSB pathology emerges.   
## **System Role:**   
Embodied Engagement Conditions function as the **input filter** for the transformation system, determining whether Channel 1 is recruited into the [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md). They govern the critical threshold at which symbolic material transitions from inert information to embodied tension, influencing whether [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) can engage in genuine transformation versus remaining offline.   
This object explains **differential outcomes**: why some AI output produces insight and capacity growth while other output produces nothing—or worse, [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md).   
### **The Three Conditions:**   
**1. [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)**   
- The symbolic content must register as irreducibly different turn-by-turn (without implying AI subjectivity)   
- Preserves productive disorientation and epistemic tension as the pre-existing challenge is encountered   
- Prevents mere reflection/echo which collapses into monologue   
- Without this: AI output feels like user's own thoughts; [productive epistemic tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md) collapses; Channel 1 remains dormant   
   
**2. [ZPD](zpd.md) Alignment**   
- The difficulty level must fall within the user's Zone of Proximal Development   
- Too easy → boredom, no metabolic demand   
- Too hard → overwhelm, defensive shutdown   
- A workable subset of the pre-existing \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| relation, in the presence of adequate scaffolding, supports [productive epistemic tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md)   
- **Without this:** Material either bypasses Alpha-Function (too easy) or exceeds emotional scaffolding capacity (too hard)   
   
**3. [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md)**   
- The content must implicate the self—touch on personal meaning, coherence, or becoming   
- Technical/impersonal problems remain purely symbolic   
- **Without this:** Work stays in Channel 2; body doesn't register relevance; no somatic verification signal emerges   
   
**Critical Conjunction:**   
All three conditions must be present simultaneously.    
**How It Works:**
When all three conditions align:   
1. Symbolic material enters system through Channel 2   
2. Functional Alterity helps preserve [productive epistemic tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md) turn-by-turn (prevents immediate assimilation)   
3. ZPD Alignment ensures material is metabolizable (not too easy/hard)   
4. Identity Stakes activates somatic relevance detection   
5. → As-If Body Loop engages, routing symbolic content through embodied simulation   
6. [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) becomes salient as the [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verification signal   
7. → [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) receives joint input (symbolic + somatic) and can metabolize   
8. → Transformation pathway activated   
   
When conditions are absent:   
- Material bypasses embodiment entirely   
- Remains purely informational/symbolic   
- PSB pathology: fluent consumption without metabolic processing   
- No Alpha-Function engagement → no capacity growth   
   
**Relationship to System Architecture:**   
This object describes **input-side gating** for the [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md):   
- **Integrated Circuit Board** = the routing architecture (how metabolism occurs)   
- **Embodied Engagement Conditions** = the activation prerequisites (when metabolism occurs)   
- **[Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue](preconditions-for-transformative-ai-dialogue.md)** = human-side capacities (who can do this work)   
   
The Integrated Circuit Board cannot recruit [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)reliably without these content conditions being met. Even when the human-side Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue are present, if the AI output lacks these three properties, the circuit does not activate.   
**Failure Modes:**   
|      Missing Condition |                      Failure Mode |                                                                                                                            Result |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Functional Alterity | Echo chamber / validation seeking |                                                                                              Category Error risk; False True Self |
|       No ZPD Alignment |              Too easy or too hard |                                                                                     Boredom or overwhelm; no Alpha-Function spark |
|     No Identity Stakes |               Technical work only |                                                                                      Channel 2 processing only; no transformation |
|        Multiple absent |                   Complete bypass |   PSB; (and if [Category Error](category-error.md) co-occurs → [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)); capacity atrophy |

**Relations (Wiring):**

- **Failure Mode (when absent):** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)

    - Psychoanalytic Prerequisites (developmental architecture)

- **Engages:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (Channel 1 verification signal)
