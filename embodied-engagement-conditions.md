# Embodied Engagement Conditions   
The three content-level prerequisites that determine whether symbolic material ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)) can sustain productive **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** rather than remaining purely abstract. These conditions specify what properties symbolic material must possess to become metabolically active and **enable** the transformation pathway. When these conditions are met, the **[Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) is more likely to engage**; when they are absent, processing tends to remain **Channel-2 dominant** and **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk increases**.   
### System Role:   
Embodied Engagement Conditions function as the **input filter** for the transformation system, determining whether sustained **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** can occur within the [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md). They govern the critical threshold at which symbolic material transitions from inert information to embodied tension, influencing whether [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) can engage in genuine transformation versus remaining offline.   
This object explains **differential outcomes**: why some AI output produces insight and capacity growth while other output produces limited change—or increases PSB risk.   
### The Three Conditions:   
**1. Functional Alterity**   
- The symbolic content must register as irreducibly different turn-by-turn (without implying [AI](ai.md) subjectivity)   
- Preserves productive disorientation and epistemic tension as the pre-existing challenge is encountered   
- Prevents mere reflection/echo which collapses into monologue   
- **Without this:** AI output feels like user's own thoughts; productive epistemic tension collapses; [Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)remains dormant   
   
**2. [ZPD](zpd.md) Alignment**   
- The difficulty level must fall within the user's Zone of Proximal Development—the distance between what they can do independently and what becomes possible with guidance/collaboration under scaffolding   
- Too easy → the assisted workspace collapses into 'no challenge' (boredom, no metabolic demand)   
- Too hard → the assisted workspace becomes unworkable (overwhelm, defensive shutdown)   
- A workable subset of the pre-existing \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| relation, in the presence of adequate scaffolding, supports productive epistemic tension   
- **Without this:** Material either bypasses Alpha-Function (too easy) or exceeds emotional scaffolding capacity (too hard)   
   
**3. Identity Stakes**   
- The content must implicate the self—touch on personal meaning, coherence, or becoming   
- Technical/impersonal problems remain purely symbolic   
- **Without this:** Work stays in Channel 2; body doesn't register relevance; no somatic verification signal emerges   
   
**Critical Conjunction:**   
All three conditions must be present simultaneously **for sustained coupling to be reliably achieved**.   
### How It Works:   
When all three conditions align:   
1. Symbolic material is present in the system (via AI engagement, whether initiated by felt tension or by direct query)   
2. [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) helps preserve productive epistemic tension turn-by-turn (prevents immediate assimilation)   
3. ZPD Alignment ensures material is metabolizable (not too easy/hard)   
4. Identity Stakes activates somatic relevance detection   
5. → [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) engages, enabling **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** through embodied simulation   
6. [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) becomes salient as the Channel 1 verification signal   
7. → Alpha-Function receives joint input (symbolic + somatic) and can metabolize   
8. → Transformation pathway becomes **available** (degree depends on sustained coupling)   
   
When conditions are absent:   
- Material tends to remain primarily symbolic/informational   
- Embodied engagement is less likely to occur   
- PSB risk increases: fluent consumption without metabolic processing   
- Alpha-Function engagement is less likely → reduced likelihood of capacity growth   
   
### Relationship to System Architecture:   
This object describes **input-side gating** for the Integrated Circuit Board:   
- **Integrated Circuit Board** = the routing architecture (how metabolism occurs)   
- **Embodied Engagement Conditions** = the activation prerequisites (when metabolism occurs)   
- **[Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue](preconditions-for-transformative-ai-dialogue.md)** = human-side capacities (who can do this work)   
   
Sustained **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** is less likely to occur reliably (via the As-If Body Loop) without these content conditions being met. Even when the human-side Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue are present, if the AI output lacks these three properties, the circuit is **less likely to engage**.   
### Failure Modes:   
|                        Missing Condition |                      Failure Mode |                                                                            Result |
|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                   No Functional Alterity | Echo chamber / validation seeking |   [Category Error](category-error.md) risk; [False True Self](false-true-self.md) |
|                         No ZPD Alignment |              Too easy or too hard |                                     Boredom or overwhelm; no Alpha-Function spark |
| No [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) |               Technical work only |                                      Channel 2 processing only; no transformation |
|                          Multiple absent |                   Complete bypass |   PSB; (and if Category Error co-occurs → Cognitive Dependency); capacity atrophy |
