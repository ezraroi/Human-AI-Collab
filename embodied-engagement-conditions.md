# Embodied Engagement Conditions   
The three content-level prerequisites that determine whether symbolic AI output [(Channel 2)](channel-2-symbolic.md) successfully recruits embodied processing [(Channel 1)](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) rather than remaining purely abstract. These conditions specify what properties symbolic material must possess to become **metabolically active** and trigger the transformation pathway. When these conditions are met, the Integrated Circuit Board engages; when absent, [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) pathology emerges.   
## **System Role:**   
Embodied Engagement Conditions function as the **input filter** for the transformation system, determining whether Channel 1 is recruited into the Recursive Metabolic Loop. They govern the critical threshold at which symbolic material transitions from inert information to embodied tension, controlling whether Alpha-Function can engage in genuine transformation versus remaining offline.   
This object explains **differential outcomes**: why some AI output produces insight and capacity growth while other output produces nothing—or worse, PSB.   
### **The Three Conditions:**   
**1. [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)**   
- The symbolic content must feel like it originates from a genuinely different mind   
- Creates productive disorientation and epistemic tension   
- Prevents mere reflection/echo which collapses into monologue   
- **Without this:** AI output feels like user's own thoughts; no tension generated; Channel 1 remains dormant   
   
**2. [ZPD](zpd.md) Alignment**   
- The difficulty level must fall within the user's Zone of Proximal Development   
- Too easy → boredom, no metabolic demand   
- Too hard → overwhelm, defensive shutdown   
- Optimal \|D-C\| gap creates [productive epistemic friciton](productive-epistemic-tension.md)   
- **Without this:** Material either bypasses Alpha-Function (too easy) or exceeds emotional scaffolding capacity (too hard)   
   
**3. [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md)**   
- The content must implicate the self—touch on personal meaning, coherence, or becoming   
- Technical/impersonal problems remain purely symbolic   
- **Without this:** Work stays in Channel 2; body doesn't register relevance; no somatic verification signal emerges   
   
**Critical Conjunction:**   
All three conditions must be present simultaneously.    
**How It Works:**
When all three conditions align:   
1. Symbolic material enters system through Channel 2   
2. Functional Alterity creates productive tension (prevents immediate assimilation)   
3. ZPD Alignment ensures material is metabolizable (not too easy/hard)   
4. Identity Stakes activates somatic relevance detection   
5. → As-If Body Loop engages, routing symbolic content through embodied simulation   
6. → Channel 1 produces felt-sense verification signal   
7. → Alpha-Function receives joint input (symbolic + somatic) and can metabolize   
8. → Transformation pathway activated   
   
When conditions are absent:   
- Material bypasses embodiment entirely   
- Remains purely informational/symbolic   
- PSB pathology: fluent consumption without metabolic processing   
- No Alpha-Function engagement → no capacity growth   
   
**Relationship to System Architecture:**   
This object describes **input-side gating** for the [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md):   
- **Integrated Circuit Board** = the routing architecture (how metabolism occurs)   
- **Embodied Engagement Conditions** = the activation prerequisites (when metabolism occurs)   
- **[Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue](preconditions-for-transformative-ai-dialogue.md)** = human-side capacities (who can do this work)   
   
The Integrated Circuit Board cannot function without these content conditions being met. Even with perfect human metacognitive capacities, if the AI output lacks these three properties, the circuit never activates.   
**Failure Modes:**   
|      Missing Condition |                      Failure Mode |                                                                                                                            Result |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Functional Alterity | Echo chamber / validation seeking |                                                                                              Category Error risk; False True Self |
|       No ZPD Alignment |              Too easy or too hard |                                                                                     Boredom or overwhelm; no Alpha-Function spark |
|     No Identity Stakes |               Technical work only |                                                                                      Channel 2 processing only; no transformation |
|        Multiple absent |                   Complete bypass |   PSB; (and if [Category Error](category-error.md) co-occurs → [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)); capacity atrophy |

**Relations (Wiring):**   
- **Triggers (when met):** Channel 1 engagement, As-If Body Loop, Alpha-Function   
- **Feeds (when met):** Recursive Metabolic Loop   
- **Failure Mode (when absent):** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Distinct From:**   
    - Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue   
    - Psychoanalytic Prerequisites (developmental architecture)   
- **Operationalized By:** [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md)    
- **Verified Through:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)
