# Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop   
Recursive Pattern–Verification Loop (RPVL) is the **continuous, real-time verification posture** through which the human tests AI-generated (and self-generated) symbolic material against **embodied knowing**, **personal symbolic grammar/idiom**, and **lived experience**. It is the epistemic safety layer that keeps alpha-function capacity engaged during dialogue so insights are **worked and verified** rather than adopted via Channel-2-only bypass—reducing vulnerability to **[Category Error](category-error.md)** (Axis A failure), **PSB** (Axis B failure), and authorship collapse.   
> Architectural precision: RPVL is not the metabolism. It is upstream quality control that prevents unverified symbolic material from entering the system as “owned meaning.”   

Specifically: it is upstream of **adoption → inscription → durable ownership**.   
### System Role   
RPVL is the **core anti-collapse mechanism** running throughout all phases of [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md), maintaining epistemic integrity while work is live.   
**[Two-Axis](two-axis-framework.md) positioning**   
- **Axis A (Relational):** maintains critical stance and epistemic responsibility → reduces Category Error / SSS drift.   
- **Axis B (Processing):** keeps embodied verification active → reduces PSB / Channel-2 bypass.   
   
### Scope (Across RP Phases)   
- **Runs throughout ALL RP phases** (not only Phase 4).   
- **Phase 2:** quality control during co-articulation (prevents premature “clicks”).   
- **Phase 3:** checks workflow alignment + delegation boundaries (protects non-delegables).   
- **Phase 4:** becomes most explicit/formal via periodic check-ins and audits.   
   
**Relationship to 4Ps (clarified):**   
- **RPVL = continuous posture** (always on).   
- **4Ps = local acceptance gate** (fires at uptake moments) **inside** RPVL.   
   
Nesting:   
```

Reflective Prompting (session structure)
  └─ RPVL (continuous verification posture)
      └─ 4Ps (local gate at uptake moments)


```
### What It Enforces and Protects   
- Prevents **[Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only adoption** ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) pathway).   
- Maintains **human authorship of meaning** (no outsourced knowing).   
- Preserves **Axis B integrity** by keeping embodied verification active.   
- Reduces **Axis A drift** by maintaining skepticism toward AI outputs and one’s first formulation.   
- Prevents premature collapse of struggle (“False-ZPD”) while **\|D–C\|** remains unchanged.   
   
**Failure mode statement:**   
Without RPVL, Reflective Prompting becomes scripting, the Journal becomes transcript, and transformation collapses into PSB.   
### Protocol Steps   
1. **Active Skepticism**   
    Detect flattery, mimicry, premature coherence, over-smooth certainty.   
2. **Embodied Verification (Channel 1)**   
    Spacious vs tight; somatic “fit” check.   
3. **Symbolic Coherence Check (Channel 2)**   
    Tests alignment with personal grammar/idiom (can I re-say it cleanly in my own words?).   
4. **Concrete Grounding**   
    Locate the lived example / operational instance; prevent abstraction drift.   
5. **Recursive Revision**   
    Insight → challenge → verification → grounding → re-articulation → new insight.   
    This recursion keeps alpha-function engagement active during dialogue.   
   
### Ownership Alarms (RPVL Degradation Signals)   
Ownership Alarms indicate RPVL is failing or being bypassed and often cue re-entry via 4Ps:   
- **Karaoke Voice** → Step 3 compromised (borrowed phrasing; not translated into idiom).   
- **Flat Soda Feeling** → Step 2 compromised (no embodied “landing”).   
- **Brittle Confidence** → Step 1 compromised (insufficient challenge).   
- **Cognitive Lag / re-entry failure** → Step 5 compromised (no recursive re-articulation).   
- **Defaulting to compliance** → posture bypassed (needs Pause/Probe immediately).   
   
### Sₑ Dependency   
RPVL presupposes **enough Sₑ to verify**. When Sₑ is depleted, verification degrades (felt sense becomes muted; skepticism becomes effortful), increasing PSB / Category Error risk.   
Rule: if RPVL repeatedly fails despite intention, **check Sₑ** before “debugging” the protocol.   
### [Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) (Connection)   
RPVL operationalizes **Protected Self-Holding** at the verification layer:   
- The human remains **container + verifier**; AI provides material, not holding.   
- Verification (especially Step 2 + Step 3) preserves the **embodied and idiomatic** dimensions of authorship.   
    When RPVL is bypassed, self-holding degrades because meaning is adopted without verification or re-articulation.   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- **[Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) — Part Of** (runs throughout all phases)   
- **[4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) — Contains / Triggers** (local gate within RPVL at uptake moments)   
- **[Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) — Stabilizes** (reduces drift on Axis A and Axis B)   
- **[Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) — Operationalizes** (human remains verifier/container)   
- **[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md) — Operationalizes** (verification + authorship posture)   
- **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) — Relies On** (primary embodied verification signal)   
- **[Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md) — Requires**   
- **Ownership Alarms — Signaled By Failure Of** (alarms indicate degradation/bypass)   
- **PSB — Protects Against** (prevents unverified fluency from becoming owned meaning)
