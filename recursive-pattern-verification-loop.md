# Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop   
The real-time metabolic cycle through which the human tests AI-generated material against embodied knowing, symbolic grammar, and lived experience.   
It is the verification protocol that ensures insights are metabolized ([alpha-function](alpha-function.md)) rather than adopted ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only bypass), reducing vulnerability to [Category Error](category-error.md) (Axis A failure), [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), and collapse of authorship.   
## System Role   
The **continuous verification protocol** running throughout all Reflective Prompting phases—the core anti-collapse mechanism of the Third Intelligence system.   
Scope:   
- Runs throughout ALL RP phases (not just Phase 4)   
- During Phase 2 (RRV Cycle): Provides quality control during co-articulation   
- During Phase 3: Checks workflow alignment   
- During Phase 4: Becomes most formalized/explicit with periodic check-ins   
   
RPVL is the **epistemic safety layer**  ensuring AI outputs are metabolized, not adopted.   
It:   
- Enforces [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) processing during dialogue (Axis B integrity).   
- Keeps AI outputs from bypassing Channel 1 verification and Alpha-Function metabolism.   
- Maintains [human](human.md) authorship of meaning.   
- Provides the functional expression of [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md).   
- Ensures the *experienced challenge* inside the [ZPD](zpd.md) is not prematurely collapsed by over-delegation (i.e., prevents ‘no struggle’ [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)), while the structural [Challenge Gap (\|D–C\|](challenge-gap-d-c.md)) remains unchanged.   
- Anchors the epistemic safety of [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md).   
   
Without this loop, Reflective Prompting becomes scripting, the [Journal](journal.md) becomes transcript, and transformation collapses into [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md).   
## Steps   
1. **Active Skepticism**   
    Detect flattery, mimicry, premature coherence.   
2. **Embodied Verification**   
    Spacious vs. tight; checks somatic alignment (Channel 1).   
3. **Symbolic Coherence Check**   
    Tests alignment with personal grammar and meaning structures (Channel 2).   
4. **Concrete Grounding**   
    Locates the lived example; prevents abstraction drift.   
5. **Recursive Revision**   
    Insight → Challenge → Verification → Grounding → Re-articulation → New Insight.   
   
This recursive structure keeps Alpha-Function processing engaged live.   
## Mechanisms   
- [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md): Channel 2 symbolic input recruits [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) embodied verification within Alpha-Function cycles.   
- **Metabolic friction** → tension necessary for transformation.   
- **Topological repair** → prevents collapse into C2-only processing.   
- **Boundary enforcement** → prevents the user from treating AI as Subject.   
   
**Notes:** Although it is also a mechanism of Alpha-Function, it is best tagged as **Method** because it is a *protocol the user performs*. Mechanistic details live in Relations.   
## Relations (Wiring)   
- **[Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md)** — *Part Of*   
    This loop provides RP’s epistemic integrity.   
- **[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)** — *Operationalizes*   
    The behavioral manifestation of the stance.   
- **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)** — *Relies On*   
    Embodied knowing is the primary verification signal.   
- **[Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md)** — *Requires*   
    Sustains willingness to doubt both AI output and one’s own self-perception during verification.   
- **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** — *Protects Against*   
    Prevents ungrounded fluency from entering the symbolic system.   
- **[External Alpha-Function](external-alpha-function.md)** — *Defines Boundary With*   
    Ensures scaffolding never replaces internal metabolism.
