# Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop   
**Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop (RPVL)** is the real-time verification protocol through which the human tests AI-generated (and self-generated) symbolic material against **embodied knowing, symbolic grammar, and lived experience**. It is the epistemic safety layer that keeps **alpha-function capacity engaged during dialogue** so that insights are **worked and verified** rather than **adopted** via [Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only bypass—reducing vulnerability to [Category Error](category-error.md) (Axis A failure), PSB, and collapse of authorship.   
> Architectural precision: RPVL is not the metabolism. It is upstream quality control that prevents unverified symbolic material from entering the system as “owned meaning.” It prepares material to become a candidate for Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW), which performs durable inscription at the Human↔Journal interface.   

### System Role   
RPVL is the continuous verification protocol running throughout **all phases** of Reflective Prompting—the core anti-collapse mechanism of the Third Intelligence system.   
**Scope**   
- Runs throughout **ALL RP phases** (not only Phase 4).   
- **Phase 2 (RRV Cycle):** quality control during co-articulation.   
- **Phase 3:** checks workflow alignment and delegation boundaries.   
- **Phase 4:** becomes most explicit/formal via periodic check-ins and audits.   
   
**What it enforces and protects**   
- Prevents Channel-2-only adoption (PSB pathway).   
- Maintains **human authorship** of meaning.   
- Preserves Axis B integrity by keeping **embodied verification** active.   
- Prevents premature collapse of struggle (“no struggle” False-[ZPD](zpd.md)) while the structural [challenge gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md) \|D-C\| remains unchanged.   
- **Prepares material for downstream EAW** by ensuring verification occurs before inscription.   
   
**Failure mode statement:**   
Without RPVL, Reflective Prompting becomes scripting, the Journal becomes transcript, and transformation collapses into PSB.   
### Steps (Protocol)   
1. **Active Skepticism**   
    Detect flattery, mimicry, premature coherence, over-smooth certainty.   
2. **Embodied Verification ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md))**   
    Spacious vs. tight; somatic “fit” check.   
3. **Symbolic Coherence Check (Channel 2)**   
    Tests alignment with personal grammar, idiom, and meaning structures.   
4. **Concrete Grounding**   
    Locates the lived example; prevents abstraction drift and false generalization.   
5. **Recursive Revision**   
    Insight → challenge → verification → grounding → re-articulation → new insight.   
    This recursive structure keeps alpha-function engagement active **in real time during dialogue**.   
   
### Mechanisms (descriptive; not architectural load-bearing)   
- **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md):** symbolic input recruits embodied simulation, enabling Channel-1 verification.   
- **[Productive Epistemic Tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md):** premature resolution signals possible bypass; tension indicates live contact with the challenge.   
- **Topological repair (system-level):** repeatedly re-links symbol → felt sense → lived example to prevent Channel-2-only collapse.   
- **Boundary enforcement:** prevents treating AI as Subject; preserves epistemic responsibility.   
   
### Relations (Wiring)    
- **[Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) — Part Of**   
    Provides epistemic integrity across phases.   
- **[RRV Cycle](rrv-cycle-recursive-refine-validate.md) — Runs During**   
    Functions as quality control at each RRV station.   
- **[Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md) — Operationalizes**   
    Behavioral manifestation of verification + authorship.   
- **[Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) — Relies On**   
    Primary embodied verification signal.   
- **[Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md) — Requires**   
    Sustains willingness to doubt AI output and one’s first formulation.   
- **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) — Protects Against**   
    Prevents ungrounded fluency from entering the symbolic system.   
- **[Enacted Alpha-Work (EAW)](enacted-alpha-work-eaw.md) — Upstream Of / Prepares For**   
    RPVL ensures dialogue material is verified before it becomes a candidate for inscription and durable ownership.   
- **EAW Semantic Commitment Loop — Shares Mechanisms With**   
    Both employ felt-sense verification and revision, but at different junctures (dialogue vs inscription).
