# 5. The Embodied Connection   
Notebook 6 focuses on cognitive "seeing," but our Unified Model integrates this with somatic "feeling."   
- The Bridge: [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) cycles metabolize [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) symbolic material through recursive oscillation with [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) embodied verification   
1. Channel 1 signals conflict (somatic tightness indicates unprocessed material)   
2. You externalize the conflict through [self-explanation](self-explanation.md) in Channel 2 (symbolic dialogue to AI).   
3. AI Mirror reflects the explanation back **as [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) (structured difference under [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance)**   
4. Channel 1 verifies the reflection (spacious = resolved; tight = still broken)   
5. [Journal](journal.md) **produces verified, owned-language inscription (writing-as-execution) when the work carries [Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md)**, creating a durable artifact for re-entry **as [chronotope](chronotope.md) (diachronic alterity / addressable past-self I-position)**   
- The Test: A "Cognitive Repair" is only valid if it produces a "Somatic Release" (The [Felt Shift](felt-shift.md)). Thinking without feeling is rationalization; feeling without thinking is anxiety (Beta Flooding). [The Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) is the integration of both.   
   
Standard metacognition research focuses on cognitive monitoring and control. This model extends that framework by integrating felt-sense checking as an additional verification input alongside metacognitive monitoring and regulation.
