# 5. The Embodied Connection   
Notebook 6 focuses on cognitive "seeing," but our Unified Model integrates this with somatic "feeling."   
- he Bridge: [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) cycles metabolize Channel 2 symbolic material through recursive oscillation with Channel 1 embodied verification   
1. [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) signals conflict (somatic tightness indicates unprocessed material)   
2. You externalize the conflict through [self-explanation](self-explanation.md) in [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (symbolic dialogue to AI).   
3. [AI](ai.md) Mirror reflects the explanation back (or the user with himself)   
4. [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verifies the reflection (spacious = resolved; tight = still broken)   
5. [Journal](journal.md) records successful alpha elements (if needed, not in all sessions)   
- The Test: A "Cognitive Repair" is only valid if it produces a "Somatic Release" (The Felt Shift). Thinking without feeling is rationalization; feeling without thinking is anxiety (Beta Flooding). The [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) is the integration of both.   
   
Standard [metacognition](metacognition.md) research focuses on cognitive monitoring and control. This model extends that framework by integrating somatic metacognition—using the felt sense as the verification mechanism that cognitive metacognition alone cannot provide.
