# 5. The Embodied Connection   
Notebook 6 focuses on cognitive "seeing," but our Unified Model integrates this with somatic "feeling."   
- The Bridge: The [Alpha Function](alpha-function.md) operates through a bidirectional loop:   
1. [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) signals conflict (somatic tightness = beta element)   
2. [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) externalizes the conflict through [self-explanation](self-explanation.md) to AI   
3. AI Mirror reflects the explanation back (or the user with himself)   
4. [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verifies the reflection (spacious = resolved; tight = still broken)   
5. [Journal](journal.md) records successful alpha elements (if needed, not in all sessions)   
- The Test: A "Cognitive Repair" is only valid if it produces a "Somatic Release" (The Felt Shift). Thinking without feeling is rationalization ([False Self](false-self.md)); feeling without thinking is anxiety (Beta Flooding). The Third Intelligence is the integration of both.   
   
Standard [metacognition](metacognition.md) research focuses on cognitive monitoring and control. This model extends that framework by integrating somatic metacognition—using the felt sense as the verification mechanism that cognitive metacognition alone cannot provide.
