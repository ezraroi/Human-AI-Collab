# 4. Mechanism Specificity Requires Condition Contrasts   
Any observed neural/physiological pattern is uninterpretable without contrasts.   
Minimum contrast set:   
1. [AI](ai.md) dialogue ([Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) posture)   
2. [Human](human.md) dialogue (matched reflective prompts)   
3. Solo reflection (no dialogue; same prompts self-applied)   
4. Journaling-only (writing without external prompts)   
5. (Optional baseline)AI output without reflective posture (passive consumption / Q&A)   
   
Goal:   
- Identify which signatures are specific to the recursive system ([Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md)) versus generic reflection, generic dialogue, or generic writing.
