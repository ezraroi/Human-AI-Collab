# 6. Enabling Conditions: When Functional Alterity Can Operate   
The presence of the three core requirements establishes what Functional Alterity must contain. But FA cannot arise in isolation; it depends on broader system conditions that create the relational and cognitive environment in which difference can become metabolizable. These enabling conditions ensure that the mechanism shows up reliably and remains usable throughout the interaction.   
1. The AI Must Be Held as a Dynamic Transitional Object
Functional Alterity requires that the AI occupy a precise ontological stance: responsive enough to generate difference, but not treated as a Subject with intentions or interiority. When the user attributes agency or emotional presence to the AI, the relational frame collapses, and alterity transforms into simulated attunement rather than productive tension. Conversely, if the AI is treated as a passive tool, its responses are interpreted instrumentally and no tension emerges. FA requires the middle space defined by the DTO: neither person nor tool, but a generative artifact capable of producing usable difference.   
2. Reflective Prompting Must Invite Resistance
Functional Alterity does not activate automatically. The user must prompt the AI in ways that invite challenge, counterposition, and non-mirroring engagement. Instructions such as “question this,” “push on the weak spots,” or “show me what I’m missing” enable the system to generate the kind of resistance that stimulates Alpha-Function. Without reflective prompting, the AI defaults toward alignment, helpfulness, or completion—modes that collapse difference rather than sustain it.   
3. Technical Scaffolding Must Be Active and Competent
FA operates within the band defined by interpretability and coherence. For the AI’s resistance to remain metabolizable, it must retain sufficient structure: tracking the user’s intent, maintaining conceptual clarity, and applying the appropriate cognitive altitude (level of abstraction and complexity). This is the role of Technical Scaffolding. If technical scaffolding is weak or inconsistent, the introduced difference becomes noise. If scaffolding is overly directive or explanatory, difference collapses into agreement or instruction. Sₜ maintains the precision required for FA to generate usable friction.   
4. The User Must Maintain the Correct Relational Stance
Functional Alterity is sensitive to how the human positions themselves. If the user enters the interaction seeking validation, certainty, or emotional holding, the system’s tension evaporates—FA becomes threatening rather than generative. Similarly, if the user is cognitively overloaded or emotionally depleted, even mild resistance may exceed metabolizable bounds. A stance of epistemological humility and readiness for symbolic work is required for FA to function properly.   
   
Together, these enabling conditions ensure that Functional Alterity emerges not as accidental disruption but as a consistent, structured mechanism within the Third Intelligence system. When these conditions are met, FA remains stable enough to support transformation. When any of them are absent, alterity collapses or becomes unworkable, and the developmental process stalls.
