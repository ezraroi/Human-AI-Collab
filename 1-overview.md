# 1. Overview   
This document integrates:   
1. Ten Winnicottian principles (phenomenology of non-intrusive field, The Self in a Non-Intrusive Field: A Winnicottian Reading of AI-Mediated Experience)   
2. The Third Intelligence architecture (transformation system)   
3. Three additional dimensions previously underspecified:   
    - Horizontal axis: Sₜ ([technical scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)) complementing Sₑ ([emotional scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md))   
    - Temporal axis: Dynamics across time (resource depletion, withdrawal protocols, capacity evolution)   
    - Shadow axis: System pathologies, failure modes, clinical boundaries   
   
### The Core Integration Principle   
Winnicott describes the CONDITIONS under which experience becomes accessible.
The [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) describes the ARCHITECTURE within which accessible experience transforms.
The integration is SEQUENTIAL, COMPLEMENTARY, and MUTUALLY COMPLETING.
