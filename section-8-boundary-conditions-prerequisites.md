# Section 8 — Boundary Conditions / Prerequisites   
This notebook supports a critical scope constraint: [Selected Fact](selected-fact.md) formation is not universally available on demand. It depends on internal capacities that must already be sufficiently developed to tolerate and metabolize [beta-elements](beta-elements.md) rather than evacuate them through premature certainty or defensive closure. In the Third Intelligence, this becomes an explicit boundary condition rather than an implicit assumption.   
**Prerequisite capacities**   
A person's ability to form and validate Selected Facts depends on:   
1. **Working [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) capacity:** a minimally reliable ability to transform raw experience into thinkable form. Without this, symbolic material (including AI output) cannot become metabolically usable; it remains either overwhelming (unprocessed affect) or merely conceptual (symbolic linkage without digestion).   
2. **Internalized containment capacity:** the ability to hold frustration, affect, and ambiguity without immediate discharge into certainty, dissociation, or compulsive meaning-making. This is consistent with the principle that containment becomes an internal apparatus once sufficiently internalized (introjected).   
3. **Frustration tolerance / [negative capability](negative-capability.md) posture:** a capacity to remain in not-knowing long enough for organization to emerge, rather than forcing coherence prematurely. This posture is not a personality trait; it is a developmental achievement that can be more or less available depending on context and current [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ).   
   
These prerequisites are not independent of Emotional Scaffolding (Sₑ): when Sₑ is depleted, [alpha-function](alpha-function.md) collapses, containment weakens, and negative capability contracts. The boundary condition is therefore both structural (developmental history) and dynamic (current state).   
**Scope statement**   
The [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system should be framed as post-Winnicottian activation, not remedial therapy. The system does not primarily build containment and alpha-function from scratch; it activates and leverages already-internalized functions by providing structured conditions: [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md), [Journal](journal.md) (as externalization substrate and return mechanism), and [Time](time.md) (as validation medium).   
This boundary condition is methodologically important: it explains differential outcomes in similar-looking [AI](ai.md) interactions and prevents overgeneralization. In the research corpus, failure cases are not treated as noise; they indicate moments where prerequisites were absent, depleted, or overridden by defensive states—thereby clarifying where the system's claims legitimately apply.
