# 4. Proper Use Cases   
### Primary: Cross-Context Pattern Recognition   
The formula's main purpose: Recognize same structural patterns across different domains.   
Examples:   
- PSB (Protein Shake Brain) has same structure as learned helplessness   
- Micromanager has same structure as helicopter parent   
- Excellent therapist has same structure as excellent teacher   
- Leadership failure has same structure as pedagogical failure   
   
How to use:   
1. Observe transformation success or failure   
2. Map the situation to formula components   
3. Identify which component(s) failed   
4. Recognize pattern in other contexts   
5. Design intervention targeting bottleneck   
   
### Secondary: Diagnostic Analysis   
When transformation fails, diagnose why:   
Step 1: Map the components   
- What was S\_e? (Did person feel safe?)   
- What was S\_t? (Was guidance appropriate?)   
- What was \|D-C\|? (Was challenge well-matched?)   
   
Step 2: Identify bottleneck   
- Which component was zero or insufficient?   
- Which relationship was broken?   
   
Step 3: Design correction   
- Target the bottleneck, not everything   
- If S\_e = 0, don't add more technique   
- If \|D-C\| too large, don't just add support - reduce gap   
   
### Tertiary: Intervention Design   
When creating transformational systems:   
Use formula as checklist:   
- [ ] Is there genuine safety (S\_e)?   
- [ ] Is there appropriate guidance (S\_t)?   
- [ ] Is challenge matched to capacity?   
- [ ] Are both scaffolds present (not just one)?   
Predict likely failure modes:   
- If we design it this way, which component becomes bottleneck?   
- Where will system likely fail?   
- What's our weakest link?
