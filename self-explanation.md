# Self-Explanation   
The cognitive process of repairing mental models. It operates through **[Gap Filling](gap-filling-inference-generation.md)** (inference) and **[Conflict Detection](conflict-detection-model-repair.md)** (repair) .   
**Notes:** An established learning mechanism, but used here as a **practical technique**, thus #Method.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (Relation: `Cognitive Equivalent Of`).   
- Link to **[Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md)** (Relation: `Core Mechanism Of`).
