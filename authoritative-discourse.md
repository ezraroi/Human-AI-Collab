# Authoritative Discourse   
A type of input that yields “tightness” in felt sense; contrast with[ Internally Persuasive Discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md).   
Discourse internalized from a coercive or misattuned environment without genuine understanding. It leads to the formation of a **[False Self](false-self.md)** based on compliance.   
**Somatic Marker:** Unlike [persuasive discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md), authoritative discourse feels physically "tight" in the body.
