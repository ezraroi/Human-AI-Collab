# Authoritative Discourse   
A mode of discourse internalized as **demand** (compliance, assimilation) rather than integrated as owned meaning. It is taken in "from above"—from authority, coercion, or misattunement—without metabolization, and therefore does not become internally persuasive.   
### Phenomenological Signature (Heuristic, Not Absolute)   
Often registers in Felt Sense as **"tightness"** (constriction, pressure, forced-fit), contrasting with the spaciousness or [Felt Shift](felt-shift.md) that accompanies internally persuasive integration.   
**Boundary:** Tightness alone is not diagnostic. It may also signal high mismatch(D,C), shame, threat, or overload. Tightness becomes evidence of Authoritative Discourse when combined with:   
- Perceived epistemic authority in the source   
- Absence of metabolic processing (no re-articulation, no felt verification)   
   
### Developmental Consequence   
**Chronic** internalization of authoritative discourse supports [False Self ](false-self.md)organization (compliance-based self-structure). Single encounters do not produce False Self—the pathology is cumulative.   
### In AI-Mediated Work   
AI output functions as Authoritative Discourse when the user:   
1. Positions the AI as epistemic authority ([SSS](subject-supposed-to-know-sss.md) / [Category Error](category-error.md) adjacency)   
2. Adopts fluent formulations without [4Ps](4ps-protocol.md)/[RPVL](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md) verification and re-articulation   
   
This is a **user-stance** condition, not an intrinsic AI property. The same output can function as Authoritative (when swallowed) or as raw material for Internally Persuasive processing (when metabolized).   
### Operational Use   
Treat tightness as a **stop-and-check signal**:   
1. **Pause** — notice the somatic constriction   
2. **Probe** — is this from perceived authority? Am I adopting without processing?   
3. **Process** — re-articulate in own words   
4. **Possess** — verify through Felt Sense + grounding   
   
If tightness persists after processing, downgrade material to "not-yet-metabolized" and reduce velocity / increase spacing.   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Theorist:** [Mikhail Bakhtin](mikhail-bakhtin.md)   
- **Contrast With:** [Internally Persuasive Discourse](internally-persuasive-discourse.md) (positive pole)   
- **Signals Through:** [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (tightness as heuristic)   
- **Contributes To:** False Self (when chronically internalized)   
- **Risk Pathway (AI):** Subject Supposed to Know → Category Error → Authoritative Discourse adoption   
- **Counteracted By:** 4Ps Protocol; RPVL; [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md)   
- **Channels:** Arrives via [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md); verified (or flagged) via [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)   
   
### Transformation Possibility   
Authoritative Discourse is not permanently fixed. Material initially internalized as demand can be re-processed through:   
- [Journal](journal.md) re-encounter (cross-temporal digestion)   
- Explicit re-articulation in idiom-aligned language   
- Felt Sense verification yielding spaciousness   
   
This transforms the material from Authoritative → Internally Persuasive, consistent with the Alpha-Function arc ([beta-elements](beta-elements.md) → [alpha-elements](alpha-elements.md)).
