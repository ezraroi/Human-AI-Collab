# 2. What the Existing Literature Actually Covers   
Across Hybrid Intelligence, Centaur models, productivity studies, explainable AI, and human-in-the-loop research, existing work coherently addresses four domains:   
**Performance Optimization** - Speed, accuracy, consistency, quality.
**Hybrid Task Execution** - How humans + AI divide or combine labor for better outputs.
**Verification and Safety** - Explainability, human oversight, interpretability.
**Identity Risk and Erosion** - [Cognitive dependency](cognitive-dependency.md), loss of ownership, "[Algorithmic Self](algorithmic-self.md)" dynamics.   
**What it does not address:**   
- How humans change metabolically (not informationally) through sustained AI dialogue   
- How [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) engages or collapses under system conditions   
- How identity reorganizes through recursive temporal accumulation   
- How longitudinal engagement ([Journal](journal.md) + [Time](time.md)) enables psychological transformation   
- How embodied verification operates within text-only interaction   
- How transformation depends on process architecture, not [AI](ai.md) capability alone   
   
Notebook 9 makes this absence explicit.
