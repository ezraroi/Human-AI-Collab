# 4. CRITICAL CONNECTION #2: "Felt Sense" = Channel 1 Verification Signal   
### Gendlin's Felt Sense (from NoteBook 2)   
- Pre-verbal bodily awareness   
- "Something" you know before you can articulate it   
- Body verification of truth ("spacious vs. tight")   
- Requires attention to interoceptive signals   
   
### Alpha Function in Channel 1 (from NoteBook 1)   
- Transforms raw [beta elements](beta-elements.md) (unprocessed sensation) into thinkable thoughts   
- Operates through embodied sensorimotor/interoceptive evaluation   
- Creates the affective coherence needed for genuine understanding   
- Pre-verbal processing that makes symbolic processing possible   
   
THE CONNECTION: The "[felt sense](felt-sense.md)" is the[ Channel 1 ](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)verification signal used within [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing. When you describe checking if something feels "spacious" or "tight" in your body, you're using Felt Sense as a Channel 1 verification signal within Alpha-Function processing.   
This explains why:   
- You can tell when AI responses feel "off" before analyzing them logically   
- **The Journal helps when inscription is required (identity-stakes work): it provides a durable substrate where Channel 2 articulation can be re-entered and re-verified through Channel 1 over Time (writing enacts semantic commitment; re-reading enables embodied re-checking).**   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) happens when [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) is bypassed — pure symbolic consumption without embodied verification
