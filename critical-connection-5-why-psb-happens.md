# CRITICAL CONNECTION #5: Why PSB Happens   
### NoteBook 1: The Category Error   
- Treating AI as [Vygotskian](lev-vygotsky.md) Subject instead of [Piagetian](jean-piaget.md) Object   
- AI provides permanent scaffolding instead of temporary   
- Collapses \|D-C\| to zero   
- Creates False Container   
   
### NoteBook 2: The Embodiment Failure   
- Reading static answers ≠ dialogical interaction   
- No anticipatory motor preparation   
- No productive tension requiring embodied verification   
- Body-mind integration short-circuited   
   
THE UNIFIED DIAGNOSIS:   
[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) happens when Channel 1 is completely bypassed:   
1. User asks question   
2. AI provides complete answer ([Channel 2 ](channel-2-symbolic.md)only - pure semantic)   
3. User passively consumes (no embodied simulation required)   
4. No "spacious vs tight" checking ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) offline)   
5. No writing/materialization (no integration point)   
6. [Alpha function](alpha-function.md) never activates   
   
The result: Knowledge flows through without transformation. Like trying to digest without a stomach. Beta elements remain beta elements.\*\*
