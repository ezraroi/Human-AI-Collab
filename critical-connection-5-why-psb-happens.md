# CRITICAL CONNECTION #5: Why PSB Happens   
### NoteBook 1: The [Category Error](category-error.md)   
- Treating AI as [Vygotskian](lev-vygotsky.md) Subject instead of [Piagetian](e.md) Object   
- AI provides permanent scaffolding instead of temporary   
- Collapses the experienced challenge inside the [ZPD](zpd.md) (while \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| remains pre-existing)   
- Creates False Container   
   
### NoteBook 2: The Embodiment Failure   
- Reading static answers ≠ dialogical interaction   
- No anticipatory motor preparation   
- No productive tension requiring embodied verification   
- Body-mind integration short-circuited   
   
THE UNIFIED DIAGNOSIS:   
[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) happens when [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) is bypassed and simulated safety enables passive consumption:   
1. User asks question   
2. AI provides symbolic content ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md)), and the user treats it as sufficient without engaging Channel 1.   
3. User passively consumes (no embodied verification engaged)   
4. No "spacious vs tight" checking ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) offline)   
5. No writing/materialization (no integration point)   
6. [Alpha-function](alpha-function.md) processing fails to engage robustly   
   
The result: Knowledge flows through without transformation. Like trying to digest without a stomach. Beta elements remain beta elements.
