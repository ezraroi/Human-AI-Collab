# 7. The Three-Legged Stool of Defense   
The methodology must stand on three supports:   
### Theoretical Specifiability ([Analytic Generalization](analytic-generalization.md))   
- **Claim**: "The [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system operates through identifiable component relationships: [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) catalyzes and sustains human [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) within adequate scaffolding"   
- **Evidence**: Mapping dialogue logs to Bionian/Bollasian models (theory-matching)   
- **Standard**: Does the case illuminate how the theory operates at individual level?   
   
### Temporal Consistency (Longitudinal Rigor)   
- **Claim**: "This is stable structural change, not state change"   
- **Evidence**: 40+ blog posts across 8 months showing evolution of narrative, capacity accumulation, and pattern recognition; 43 curated learning notebooks evidencing Destiny Drive articulation   
- **Standard**: Do patterns persist across time? Do withdrawal phases show expected dynamics?   
   
### Adjudicated Falsification (Critical Testing)   
- **Claim**: "The result is not confirmation bias"   
- **Evidence**: Documented manic episodes, moments of disagreement, system failures   
- **Standard**: Has the researcher actively sought and documented counter-evidence?
