# 11. Practical Implications for Reflective Prompting   
Functional Alterity does not emerge automatically; it must be invited. Reflective Prompting is the method that activates FA by asking the AI to introduce tension rather than clarity. Prompts such as “question this,” “push where this feels weak,” “show what I’m not seeing,” or “surface the hidden assumption here” explicitly signal to the system that resistance—not agreement—is required. This shifts the AI out of its default helpfulness pattern and enables the narrow-band operation where difference becomes metabolizable.   
When Reflective Prompting is active, the user becomes an architect of tension. Instead of waiting for the AI to decide how much difference to introduce, the user calibrates the level of resistance directly. This protects against sycophancy, premature coherence, and alignment drift—all patterns that neutralize the Challenge Gap. Reflective Prompting therefore acts as the human-side regulator of FA: it ensures that the interaction remains challenging enough to activate Alpha-Function while maintaining interpretability and emotional safety.   
Functional Alterity and Reflective Prompting are mutually reinforcing. FA provides the micro-resistance that keeps symbolic work alive; RP ensures that resistance remains intentional rather than accidental. Together, they create a reliable interaction pattern in which meaning must be earned through articulation and verification rather than delivered through completion or explanation. This relational posture keeps authorship with the human and preserves the developmental logic of the Third Intelligence system.
