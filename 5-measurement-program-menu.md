# 5. Measurement Program Menu   
### Tier A — Minimal viable pilot (triangulation first)   
Purpose: establish practical discriminators without expensive imaging.   
Inputs   
- Session tagging: metabolization vs bypass vs collapse vs reward-driven pseudo-safety (based on the discriminator framework)   
- Time-stamped “[felt shift](felt-shift.md)” markers (self-report + journaling annotation)   
   
Measures   
- [ANS](autonomic-nervous-system-regulation-ans-vagal-.md) proxies: HRV, heart rate reactivity/recovery, respiration pattern, skin conductance (where available)   
- Stress proxies: optional cortisol sampling (where feasible; interpret cautiously)   
- Behavioral ownership tests: reconstruction without [AI](ai.md); persistence checks after spacing; real-world verification logs   
- Usage signatures: repetition/escalation markers indicating reinforcement risk   
   
Outputs   
- A first-pass discriminator set: what correlates with “good sessions” vs counterfeit ones.   
   
Tier B — Mechanistic lab study (network dynamics)   
Purpose: test the network hypotheses under controlled contrasts.   
Candidate methods:   
- EEG (temporal dynamics; event-related markers around felt shift)   
- fNIRS (pragmatic cortical engagement proxies; less intrusive than fMRI)   
- fMRI (network-level coupling/switching; expensive but powerful)   
   
Design requirements:   
- Condition contrasts from Section 4   
- Timestamped prompts + participant markers of salient moments   
- Separate “output quality” from “integration quality” (avoid confusing fluency with metabolization)   
   
Outputs:   
- Evidence for/against the hypothesized coordination dynamics (not just “activation”).   
   
Tier C — Longitudinal durability study (6–12 months)   
Purpose: test whether any neural/physiological signatures track durable identity-level change.   
Core elements:   
- Repeated measures across months (resting-state and/or task-based)   
- Consolidation-aware sampling (sleep, spacing, post-session conditions)   
- Behavioral durability metrics aligned to project criteria:   
    - persistence   
    - ownership   
    - reconstructability without AI   
    - real-world directional change   
   
Outputs:   
- Constrain “[Time](time.md)” claims: consolidation as mechanism, not metaphor.
