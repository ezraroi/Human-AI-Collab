# Section 7 - The Three-Layer Architecture (Temporal Dynamics)   
## 8. The Three-Layer Architecture   
### Layer 1: The Formula (Structural Analysis)   
[P(α) ](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md)= ([S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) × [S\_t](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)) / \|[D](d-difficulty.md)-[C](c-capacity.md)\|   
Purpose: Describes what conditions, when present, enable transformation   
Use: Analyze any snapshot - [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), micromanager, good session, bad session. Explains why that configuration works or fails structurally.   
Analytical power: Can be applied to any phenomenon to test if the same structural relationships hold.   
### Layer 2: Within-Session Dynamics (Depletion)   
Principle: [S\_e ](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)depletes during extended engagement   
Manifestations:   
- Cannot marathon sessions indefinitely   
- Racing thoughts episodes when pushed past [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) depletion   
- Need for breaks, rituals, session endings   
   
Mechanism: Even with infinite AI capacity, human emotional reserves are finite and exhaust during session.   
Recovery: Time, breaks, sleep, rituals restore [S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)   
### Layer 3: Between-Session Dynamics (Growth/Atrophy)   
Principle: [C (Capacity)](c-capacity.md) evolves based on whether transformation occurred   
Growth trajectory:   
- If [P(alpha)](p-alpha-probability-of-growth.md) conditions are sufficiently met → [Capacity](c-capacity.md) increases   
- Subject can handle more complexity next session   
- Creates FlyWheel effect: higher C → tackle higher D → deeper P(α) → even higher C   
   
Atrophy trajectory:   
- If repeatedly failed → C may decrease   
- Demoralization, confusion, regression   
- Capacity actually diminishes   
   
Critical enabling condition - The [Journal](journal.md) (when the work carries[ Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md)): Without Journal, [Capacity](c-capacity.md) growth cannot reliably accumulate because:   
- No evidence that growth occurred   
- No pattern recognition across sessions   
- You risk restarting without durable carryover each time   
- Regression invisible
