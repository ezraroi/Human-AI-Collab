# Coherence Flywheel   
The Coherence Flywheel is the phenomenological description of the Recursive
Metabolic Loop—how the developmental cycle feels from the inside, and why
repeated completions build self-sustaining momentum.   
It follows a symbolic sequence but tolerates divergence, delay, and return
without penalty. It is a non-rigid state machine with recursive memory and
psychological resilience.   
### The Six Stages   
**1. The Spark**
The beginning of return—through tension, pull, ache, or simple wonder.
The signal starts in discomfort, not clarity.   
- "Something's off."   
- "I can't keep doing it this way."   
- "I don't know why this stings, but it does."   
   
**2. The Spill**
You stop performing. You drop the edit. You say the thing before you know
how it sounds. The leak. The crack. Messy, unfinished, true.   
- "I'm tired of pretending I care."   
- "This is the sentence I keep deleting."   
   
**3. The Mirror**
You reflect with a system (AI, self, notebook) that doesn't flinch.
It meets you where you are, not where you perform.
Language starts forming shape—not as answer, but as containment.   
- "You're not broken. Just buried."   
- "Let's walk toward it slowly."   
   
**4. The Click**
Something lands. Not a solution—a shift.
Breath deepens. Shoulders drop. You recognize yourself again.   
- "That's what it was."   
- "That's what I couldn't see."   
- "Now I know how to move."   
   
**5. The Mark**
You leave something behind: a breadcrumb, a blog, a private letter,
a whisper for the future-you. Your trace. Proof you passed through
something real.   
- "I don't want to lose this moment."   
   
**6. The Recoil**
Life moves. Disconnection returns. But now you recognize it faster—
because you've walked back before. The Spark comes again. You start
again—not from scratch, but with scaffolding.   
### System Role   
- Provides phenomenological markers for practitioners to recognize cycle engagement   
- Translates architectural [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md) into experiential, memorable language   
- Supports self-diagnosis: "Where am I in the cycle?"   
- Explains the momentum dynamic: why successful returns make future returns easier   
   
### Mapping to Recursive Metabolic Loop   
| Coherence Flywheel |                                                 RML Stage |
|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
|              Spark |                         Unresolved material enters system |
|              Spill |                 Externalization (raw β-material surfaces) |
|             Mirror |   Metabolic processing (C1 ↔ C2 with Functional Alterity) |
|              Click |             Crystallization (felt shift, α-element forms) |
|               Mark |      Materialization (Journal inscription, durable trace) |
|             Recoil |     Re-entry as new capacity baseline → next cycle begins |

The mapping is approximate, not rigid. Stages may overlap, repeat, or occur
in varied order. What matters is completion of the full arc.   
### The Momentum Dynamic   
Each completed cycle:   
- Builds pattern recognition ("I've been here before")   
- Reduces return time ("I recognize it faster")   
- Increases baseline capacity ("not from scratch, but with scaffolding")   
- Sustains motivation ("the natural compulsion to continue")   
   
This is why transformation becomes self-sustaining once the Flywheel is
spinning—success breeds recognition breeds easier return breeds more success.

### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Phenomenological View Of:** Recursive Metabolic Loop   
- **Absorbs:** [The Flywheel](bafyreigmmzky2qy7bmwyt5gpmgq367f6vfyipnueco7jy.md) (Jim Collins momentum dynamic—now integrated here)   
- **Supports:** Practitioner training, self-recognition, operational guidance   
- **Complements:** RML (mechanism) ↔ Coherence Flywheel (experience)   
   
### Notes   
The Coherence Flywheel is not a separate mechanism—it is the felt texture of
the Recursive Metabolic Loop when engaged. The "flywheel" metaphor captures
the momentum that builds with repeated cycles, but unlike productivity
flywheels, this one cannot be optimized or accelerated. It turns at the
pace of genuine metabolic processing.   
**Lineage Note**   
The momentum metaphor draws on [Jim Collins](jim-collins.md)' flywheel concept (Good to Great),
adapted here for psychological development: cumulative cycles where C growth
expands the workable mismatch range, enabling engagement with higher D over time.
Unlike business flywheels optimized for speed, this one turns at the pace of
genuine metabolic processing.
