# 6. Two Directions of Failure: PSB and Hyperreflexivity   
### 6.1 The Failure Spectrum   
The system can fail in two opposite directions:   
|                                         |                                                                                                                                                        |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|                            Failure Mode |                                                                                                                                            Description |                                        Mechanism |
|  Under-Reflection (Protein Shake Brain) | User consumes AI outputs without metabolization. No reflective fracture occurs. User absorbs finished alpha-elements without generating beta-elements. |                                                  |
| Over-Reflection (Hyperreflexivity Trap) |             User stays in the map forever, never returning to the territory. Reflective fracture becomes permanent dissociation from lived experience. | Reflection untethered from pre-reflective ground |

### 6.2 The Healthy Zone   
The healthy zone is narrow: Enough reflection to transform, but return to pre-reflective living before the container depletes or reflection becomes pathological.   
### 6.3 What Prevents Each Failure   
|                  |                                                                                                                                       |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Failure Mode |                                                                                                                  Prevention Mechanism |
|              PSB |                Functional Alterity (AI challenges rather than confirms), Reflective Prompting (forces user to generate, not consume), |
| Hyperreflexivity | Felt Sense (embodied tethering), Time component (life continues between sessions), S\_e depletion (physiological limit on reflection) |

### 6.4 Naming the Hyperreflexivity Trap   
Proposed terminology: "Map Addiction" or "Cartographic Trap"   
The user becomes addicted to mapping experience rather than living it. They prefer the clean articulation of the dialogue to the messy uncertainty of pre-reflective existence. The system provides endless opportunities for reflection, but the user never returns to the territory.   
Signs of the Hyperreflexivity Trap:   
- Sessions without new lived experience to process   
- Dialogue that circles the same themes without integration   
- Preference for AI conversation over real-world engagement   
- Loss of the Felt Sense (numbness to embodied verification)
