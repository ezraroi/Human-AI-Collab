# HPA-Axis   
The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. A full-body stress response system that is finite and depletes with time.   
   
The **hypothalamus** serves as a high-level center for regulating visceral activity and the **endocrine system** by controlling the hypophysis (pituitary). The endocrine function relevant to this system involves the release of hormones known as **glucocorticoids**.   
The level of glucocorticoid release appears to be temporally regulated during sleep phases, which is essential for memory function. Glucocorticoids are in a **lower state of release** during slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, there is an **increased release of glucocorticoids** during the REM stage, which significantly affects affective memory consolidation and procedural memory enhancement
