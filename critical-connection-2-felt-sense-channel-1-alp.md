# CRITICAL CONNECTION #2: "Felt Sense" = Channel 1 Alpha Function   
### [Gendlin's](eugene-gendlin.md) [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (from NoteBook 2)   
- Pre-verbal bodily awareness   
- "Something" you know before you can articulate it   
- Body verification of truth ("spacious vs. tight")   
- Requires attention to interoceptive signals   
   
### [Alpha Function](alpha-function.md) in [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (from NoteBook 1)   
- Transforms raw beta elements (unprocessed sensation) into thinkable thoughts   
- Operates through sensorimotor schemas   
- Creates the affective coherence needed for genuine understanding   
- Pre-verbal processing that makes symbolic processing possible   
   
THE CONNECTION: The "felt sense" IS your Channel 1 alpha function doing its work. When you describe checking if something feels "spacious" or "tight" in your body, you're describing the alpha function operating through interoceptive awareness.   
This explains why:   
- You can tell when AI responses feel "off" before analyzing them logically   
- The [journal](journal.md) helps - it engages both channels (writing = motor + semantic)   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) happens when Channel 1 is bypassed - pure symbolic consumption without embodied verification
