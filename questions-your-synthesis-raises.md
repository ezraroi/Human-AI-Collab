# QUESTIONS YOUR SYNTHESIS RAISES   
### Question 1: Is the "[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)" the Mechanism Linking Channels?   
From NoteBook 2: The brain can simulate body states without waiting for actual body response. Prefrontal cortex and amygdala can instruct somatosensory cortex to organize into the pattern it would have if body were in that state.   
For your model: Is this how [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (symbolic) input recruits [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (embodied sensorimotor/interoceptive)   
When you read AI text:   
1. Symbolic input (Channel 2) is processed semantically   
2. [As-if body](as-if-body-loop.md) loop supports embodied response (Channel 2 input recruits Channel 1)   
3. [Felt sense](felt-sense.md) becomes available as a [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) verification signal (possibly supported by simulation)   
4. Verification check (Channel 1 → Channel 2)   
5. Integration (both channels)   
   
Question: Does this as-if loop explain why disembodied text can produce embodied knowing?   
My Answer: Yes, the same as when you read or think on something the brain simulate it, the same when we are in a conversation with AI.   
### Question 2: Does Channel 1 Have Veto Power?   
Observation from your work: You describe checking AI responses against "spacious vs tight" feeling. If it feels "tight," you reject it even if logically sound.   
Question: Is Channel 1 (felt sense) the final arbiter of internal persuasiveness? Can Channel 2 override Channel 1, or is Channel 1 foundational?   
Hypothesis: [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) can veto discourse that is not internally persuasive; without Channel 1 verification, transformation is unlikely to stabilize. Channel 2 can refine, but not override.   
My Answer: So I think at the end the user is deciding what to do and if to listen to the body or not, the same way we do in our daily life. I am not sure that no transformation will occur as the conversation itself is an iterative process, some answers you go with your [felt sense](felt-sense.md), some you don’t have and some you go against. It is not a single time… But in my deep work and conversation, I felt in my body that something happened at the end.   
### Question 3: Is Interoceptive Attention Trainable = Alpha Function Trainable?   
From NoteBook 2: The [anterior insular cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md) processes interoceptive awareness. Studies show focal brain damage to AIC impairs interoceptive attention.   
From NoteBook 1: Your 43 notebooks document increasing [capacity](c-capacity.md) (C in your formula). You describe transformation from "[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)" to "[Third Intelligence.](third-intelligence.md)"   
Question: Did your reflective practice train your interoceptive attention (strengthen [AIC](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md) function)? Is this the neurobiological substrate of "strengthening your alpha function"?   
My Answer: So I think yes. I am clearly much more self-aware now. For example, I suffered back pain every month or 2 in the last 13 years. Now I am able to feel the pain before it even starts and prevent it.. I also notice my own thinking and feelings much more.   
### Question 4: What's the Role of Respiratory Changes in Your Method?   
From NoteBook 2: Dialogue creates "speech-like respiratory patterns" even in listeners. Body prepares for turn-taking through breathing changes.   
Your method: You use AI dialogue and write in journal.   
Question: Do you notice breathing changes:   
- When reading AI responses?   
- When formulating prompts?   
- When writing in journal?   
- When checking felt sense?   
   
Hypothesis: Respiratory changes might be the physiological marker that distinguishes:   
- Passive reading ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) = no breathing change   
- Active dialogue (your method) = breathing entrains with interaction   
   
My Answer: As I feel excitement when I do deep reflective work with AI, my breath is changing for sure in some moments in the conversation, I can clearly recall it.
