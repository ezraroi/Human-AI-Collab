# False True Self   
The **False True Self** is a version of selfhood that **feels authentic** but is actually built on **simulated (non-lived) foundations**.   
It is defined as the **False Self wearing the mask of the True**, and it emerges when the existing [False Self](false-self.md) is **reinforced by AI-generated simulated relational safety**. This simulated authenticity is based on flattery, instant validation, and collapsed experienced challenge.   
**Notes:** AI-amplified pseudo-authenticity state.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[False Self](false-self.md)** (Relation: `Variant Of`).   
- Link to **[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** (Relation: `Result Of`).   
- Link to **[AI](ai.md)** (Relation: `Facilitated By`).
