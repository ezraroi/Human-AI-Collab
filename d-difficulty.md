# D (Difficulty)   
**Definition:** The complexity of the task, idea, or emotional experience. It represents the "load" of unprocessed beta-elements.   
**System Goal:** To maintain a "[Productive Epistemic Tension](productive-epistemic-tension.md)" where $D$ slightly exceeds C.   
**Pathology:** In "[Protein Shake Brain](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)," D collapses to 0 because the AI provides answers before the user struggles.
