# Jacques Lacan   
Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) was a highly controversial and influential French psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and philosopher, often called "the most controversial psycho-analyst since Freud". He sought a "return to Freud" but reinterpreted Freud’s work using linguistics, philosophy, and mathematics, radically reshaping psychoanalytic theory.   
Key Contributions   
- **The Unconscious Structured Like a Language:** Lacan's central thesis is that the unconscious does not deal in instinctual drives alone, but operates according to the rules of language, with its own complex structures of metaphor and metonymy.   
- **The Three Orders (Registers):** He described three fundamental domains of human experience:   
    - **The Imaginary:** The realm of images, fantasy, the ego, and identification, centered on mirror images and illusions of wholeness.   
    - **The Symbolic:** The domain of language, law, culture, and social structures (like gender roles), which shapes our identity and inserts us into society.   
    - **The Real:** The unattainable dimension of reality that resists symbolization or imagination—it is the traumatic, impossible core of existence.   
- **The Mirror Stage:** A formative moment (between 6-18 months) where an infant recognizes itself in a mirror (or through the gaze of a caregiver), leading to the formation of a unified sense of "I" (the ego), though this identity is always fundamentally alienated and rooted in an external image.   
- Desire and The Object ***a*:** Lacan argued that human desire is not a simple need, but a continuous, elusive craving for a "lost" fulfillment, driven by a lack in being. The *objet petit a* (object a) is the partial, unobtainable object that appears to be the cause of this desire.   
- **Variable-Length Sessions:** In clinical practice, he controversially abandoned fixed session times, ending sessions abruptly based on clinical moments, not the clock, a practice that led to a schism in the international psychoanalytic community.   
   
Lacan remains a dominant, albeit difficult, figure in modern psychoanalysis, continental philosophy, and literary theory.
