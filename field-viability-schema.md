# Field Viability Schema   
A relational schema describing the ongoing field conditions that must continuously hold for the recursive transformative process to remain metabolically possible.   
**Notation:**   
> (S_e ⊗ S_t) calibrated to mismatch(D, C), such that experienced mismatch remains in a workable range.   

*(mismatch(D,C) denotes effective/experienced mismatch, not objective task difficulty).*   
**Viability Semantics:**   
Field viability is treated as **graded** (e.g., **viable / marginal / non-viable**), not binary.   
**Ontological Status:**   
- A diagnostic/teaching schema in the tradition of Lewin’s B = f(P,E)   
- Describes what must be *continuously sustained*, not momentarily checked   
- Not a probability, calculation, or prediction   
- Reveals relational dependencies without being computable   
   
### The Three Core Constraints   
1. **Non-Substitutability of Scaffolds ([Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) ⊗ [Technical Scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md))**   
   
Emotional holding and technical guidance are jointly necessary. The ⊗ denotes non-substitutable coupling: one cannot compensate for the absence of the other.   
- If S\_e → 0: field viability compromised regardless of S\_t   
- If S\_t → 0: field viability compromised regardless of S\_e   
- Manifests as degrees and localities, not necessarily binary collapse   
   
**2. Calibration to Mismatch**   
Scaffolding is meaningful only relative to the challenge gap. Different [challenge gap](challenge-gap-d-c.md)s (size and type) require different levels and kinds of scaffolding.   
- [D](d-difficulty.md) is multidimensional: cognitive complexity, affect load, identity stakes, novelty   
- Calibration is to size AND type of mismatch   
- The relationship is partly bidirectional: scaffolding modulates experienced (not just objective) mismatch   
   
**3. Workable Range ([ZPD](zpd.md) Window)**   
Experienced mismatch must remain within a workable range—neither bypassed nor unbridgeable.   
- Gap bypassed → [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (no pressure to metabolize)   
- Gap unbridgeable → Overwhelm (system cannot function)   
- Optimal → ZPD (tension exists but remains containable)   
   
### Architectural Position   
The Field Viability Schema describes **conditions**, not mechanisms or outcomes.   
**Dependency structure:**   
- **Presupposes:** Correct relational stance (Two-Axis Axis A). If Category Error is present, the schema becomes uninterpretable—perceived Sₑ/Sₜ inflate artificially, creating false viability.   
- **Enables:** Metabolic processing (Alpha-Function operating within the ICB). When field viability holds, processing can occur.   
- **Does not contain:** Journal or Time—these operate at the accumulation level (between-session), while the schema describes ongoing conditions.   
   
**Temporal scope:** Continuous. Field viability must be sustained throughout processing, not merely checked at a single point.   
**Relationship to Two-Axis Framework:**
The Field Viability Schema functions as the **Viability Envelope** within which the Two-Axis configuration plane operates.   
- **Viable:** Configuration plane is operative; stance can be maintained   
- **Marginal:** Configuration unstable; drift toward failure modes likely   
- **Non-viable:** Configuration collapses regardless of intention   
   
The [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) diagnoses **configuration**.
The Field Viability Schema diagnoses **operability**.   
For full temporal dynamics mapping, see Section 7: Temporal Dynamics Across the Architecture.   
### Relationship to [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md) (Viability Envelope)   
The Field Viability Schema functions as the **Viability Envelope**
within which the Two-Axis configuration plane operates.   
- **Viable:** Configuration plane is operative; stance can be maintained   
- **Marginal:** Configuration unstable; drift toward failure modes likely   
- **Non-viable:** Configuration collapses regardless of intention   
   
The Two-Axis Framework diagnoses *configuration*.
The Field Viability Schema diagnoses *operability*.   
### Depletion Dynamics   
Viability is **stateful** within-session and between sessions:   
- Within-session: Se depletes over time; St tolerance decreases   
- Between-session: Recovery possible with adequate rest/grounding   
- Cumulative: Sustained low viability erodes baseline capacity   
   
A viable person can become non-viable mid-session.
A non-viable person can recover viability between sessions.   
### Gating Rule (Canonical)   
**Do not introduce St (challenge/[Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md)) when Se is collapsed.**   
Rebuild containment before reintroducing productive tension.
This prevents iatrogenic impingement when viability is compromised.   
Sequence: Se first → then St becomes safe → then challenge becomes growth   
### Diagnostic Failure Modes   
|        Failure Mode |                                                                Schema Diagnosis |                                                 Structural Pattern |
|:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             **PSB** |  Experienced mismatch bypassed; metabolic pressure eliminated before engagement |                   AI completes before struggle recruits α-function |
| **Safety Collapse** |                          S\_e → 0; non-substitutability causes field compromise |                                  "Brilliant but toxic" environment |
|       **Overwhelm** |                                               Mismatch >> available scaffolding |                         Gap unbridgeable even with support present |
|         **Boredom** |                                                   C >> D; no productive tension |                                         Expert given trivial tasks |
|  **Technical Void** |                                                 S\_t → 0; no guidance/structure |                                           Warmth without substance |
|   **Manic Episode** |                                  Actual S\_e depletion + hallucinated viability | Boundary case consistent with schema; reveals failure mode vividly |
|  **Category Error** | Axiom violation: inflates perceived S\_e/S\_t, corrupts Felt Sense verification |                 Creates false viability; user cannot self-diagnose |
