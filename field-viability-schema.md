# Field Viability Schema   
Field Viability Schema is the **runtime viability test** for whether [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) work is **operable right now**. It specifies when a **Viability Envelope** can form (and remain stable) given:   
- **Mismatch** between challenge and capacity (**\|D – C\|**)   
- **[Emotional scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)** (**Sₑ**) available in the human container   
- **[Technical scaffolding](technical-scaffolding-s_t.md)** (**Sₜ**) available in the interaction/tooling   
   
**Core claim:** Field viability is a **state-dependent, runtime property**—not a trait. It can fluctuate **moment-to-moment** within a session and across days.   
### Viability Envelope   
A viable envelope exists when **Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ is sufficient relative to \|D – C\|**.   
- **Sₑ is non-substitutable:** technical scaffolding cannot replace depleted emotional scaffolding.   
- **Sₜ is supportive:** it can reduce friction and improve structure, but cannot supply containment.   
   
### Failure Attractors and Collapse Patterns   
When the envelope collapses:   
- **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk rises** (Channel-2-only adoption; fluent but unowned material),   
- **[Category Error](category-error.md) risk rises** (authority drift under depletion/need),   
- **agency degrades** (outsourcing, validation-seeking, loss of authorship).   
   
A common pattern is **false viability**: high fluency while Sₑ is actually failing.   
### Depletion Dynamics   
Envelope degradation can occur via:   
- **Overload:** \|D – C\| too high for available Sₑ (even with strong Sₜ),   
- **Brittleness:** Sₑ adequate but Sₜ too weak → turbulence and wasted effort,   
- **Accumulated depletion:** repeated uptake without recovery → late-session collapse.   
   
**State vs. Trait clarification (operational):**   
- A **Zone C** user with depleted Sₑ can be **currently non-viable**.   
- A **Zone B** user with adequate Sₑ + scaffolding can be **currently viable**.   
   
### Routing Rules   
When viability degrades:   
1. **Downshift difficulty** (reduce \|[D – C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\|) and/or increase Sₜ (structure).   
2. **Prioritize Sₑ restoration** (stop forcing uptake).   
3. If tightness persists / verification fails repeatedly → **Touch Grass Protocol**.   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
- **Runtime Assessment Of:** current field operability (state-dependent)   
- **Gates:** stable occupancy of the [Two-Axis](two-axis-framework.md) viable quadrant (cannot hold posture/processing when the field is non-viable)   
- **Constituted By:** Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ relative to mismatch(\|D – C\|)   
- **Mode-Setting Link:** SN mode-setting as minimal handle for integrative vs defensive processing availability   
- **Distinct From:** [Activation Conditions](activation-conditions.md) (baseline/trait layer)   
- **Failure Attractors:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), Category Error, agency collapse   
- **Enforced By:** [Touch Grass Protocol ](touch-grass-protocol.md)(restore Sₑ; prevent forced uptake)
