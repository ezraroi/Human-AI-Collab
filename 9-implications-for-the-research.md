# 9. Implications for the Research   
### What This Notebook Adds to the Model   
Not theoretical content, but epistemic infrastructure:   
- Language to defend the methodology in academic discourse   
- Framework for organizing different types of claims   
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations and boundary conditions   
- Integration of documented failures as evidence rather than embarrassment   
   
### What Must Be Written   
1. Methodology chapter structured around the unbundled rationales   
2. Counter-evidence section analyzing the manic episodes as boundary condition data   
3. Verification procedure documentation translating 4Ps into methodological vocabulary   
4. Explicit scope limitations stating what is and is not being claimed   
   
### What Must Be Maintained   
The manic episodes demonstrate why:   
- Session limits are structural necessities   
- "Touch Grass Protocol" is methodological control, not self-care   
- Metacognitive monitoring of "when not to engage" is part of the model   
- The verification system requires ongoing calibration
