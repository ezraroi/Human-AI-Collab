# Antonio Damasio   
**Antonio Damasio** is a highly influential neuroscientist and researcher known primarily for developing the **[Somatic Marker Hypothesis](somatic-marker-hypothesis.md) (SMH)**, a theory that posits emotion-based, or "somatic," biasing signals generated from the body (or the brain's representation of the body) are essential for regulating reasoning and decision-making, particularly in situations of uncertainty. Damasio's work often centers on understanding how emotions and feelings are generated in the brain and how they contribute to consciousness. His research, often conducted with his colleagues, demonstrated that patients with damage to the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)** exhibit severe deficits in emotional regulation and everyday decision-making, which he linked to an inability to use these somatic markers. His conceptualizations include the distinction between the physical **"body loop"** and the purely neural, predictive **"[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)"** (which we discussed previously), enabling fast decision guidance by simulating bodily reactions internally. Damasio's research has utilized tools like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to support the SMH, investigating how body-state changes (somatic markers) influence cognitive choices
