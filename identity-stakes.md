# Identity Stakes   
Identity Stakes represent the **threshold where information becomes self-relevant** and shifts from abstract knowledge to material for self-construction.   
[Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) tends to engage most strongly when the symbolic tension touches the becoming self.   
### System Role   
- Marks symbolic material as self-relevant so embodied processing can engage *(when paired with [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) and [ZPD](zpd.md) Alignment)*   
- Acts as the bridge between psychoanalytic development (**idiom articulation as an expression of the [True Self](true-self.md)**) and cognitive metabolism.   
- Helps determine whether AI output enters the transformation pathway (as one of the three [Embodied Engagement Conditions](embodied-engagement-conditions.md)) or remains purely intellectual.   
- Explains why reflective writing, leadership questions, and meaning-making activate the body more reliably than technical tasks.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Derived From:** [Christopher Bollas](christopher-bollas.md) (idiom, self-coherence formation; [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) as latent→articulated vector)   
- **Activates:** [Metabolic Activation](embodied-engagement-conditions.md)   
- **Enables:** Alpha-Function engagement (when paired with Functional Alterity and ZPD Alignment), which feeds [Recursive Metabolic Loop ](recursive-metabolic-loop.md)cycle completion   
   
**Notes:** Self-relevant work
