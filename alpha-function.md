# Alpha-Function   
The internal, embodied process of metabolizing raw, unthinkable experience (Beta-Elements) into thinkable thoughts ([Alpha-Elements](alpha-elements.md))—[felt sense](felt-sense.md) made thinkable.   
**Phenomenological Root (Husserl):** Maps to **Noesis**.   
This is the subjective act of experiencing or meaning-making. It is the metabolic process that transforms raw *Hyle* into meaningful *Noema*.   
**System Role:** The “Engine” of the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md). It is sparked when the experienced challenge is held long enough for metabolization (while \|[D–C](challenge-gap-d-c.md)\| remains pre-existing).   
### Local Failure Mode ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) – Protein Shake Brain)   
When the Alpha-Function is bypassed or under-engaged, symbolic material is processed without sustained **C1 ↔ C2 coupling** (metabolic processing). AI outputs or abstractions are “consumed” directly, producing:   
- outward fluency without inward transformation,   
- narrative coherence without somatic resonance,   
- insights that do not change behavior or identity,   
- journal entries that remain conceptual, thin, or AI-heavy.   
   
This is the Alpha-Function’s component-level collapse.   
### Interaction Dynamics (Propagation Rules)   
When Alpha-Function is offline or overwhelmed:   
- Somatic signals (if present) fail to be integrated, so processing becomes symbol-dominant; **Symbolic Overrun** emerges specifically when the **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) is weak or bypassed**.   
- Journal becomes corrupted (**when the work carries Identity Stakes**): entries are written without metabolization, producing pseudo-insight or thin narratives.   
- **Durable [Capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) growth is compromised:** metabolization does not reliably produce owned α-elements that can accumulate over Time.   
- **Axis B collapses** into a [Channel-2](channel-2-symbolic.md)-only processing pattern (skipping digestion, just consuming AI answers) → the hallmark of PSB.   
   
Alpha-Function failure therefore propagates through the entire circuit.   
### Phenomenology (How Alpha-Function Feels When Online vs Offline)   
**When Alpha-Function is online:**   
- A sense of “frustration → reorganization → relief.”   
- Experiential “clicks” or felt shifts (spaciousness).   
- Insight feels personally owned, not just understood.   
- Writing comes in your own language.   
- Ambiguity feels tolerable long enough for transformation to occur.   
   
**When Alpha-Function is offline (PSB):**   
- Sudden clarity without struggle.   
- No felt shift; no somatic signature.   
- Insights feel “true” instantly but are unstable across time.   
- Writing feels detached, imitative, or over-abstracted.   
- Tension is avoided rather than metabolized.   
   
These phenomenological markers are the easiest way to detect Alpha engagement in real time.   
### Sₑ Dependency (Qualitative Energy Constraint)   
Alpha-Function draws heavily on Sₑ — the system’s emotional capacity to tolerate frustration, uncertainty, and disruption.   
- **High Sₑ:** Alpha can hold tension long enough to metabolize beta-elements.   
- **Low Sₑ:** Alpha collapses into avoidance, symbolic bypass, or manic acceleration.   
- **Sₑ depletion:** requires recovery periods ([Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md)) to restore metabolic capacity.   
   
Sₑ is not a measurable quantity; it is a qualitative limit on how deeply Alpha can process material.   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Part Of:** [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) (Axis B architecture)   
- **Requires:** As-If Body Loop for **C1 ↔ C2 coupling capability**; sufficient Sₑ for frustration tolerance   
- **Counteracted By:** PSB (when Alpha-Function is bypassed)   
- **Constrained By:** Axis A ([Category Error](category-error.md) increases vulnerability and PSB risk by making the relational stance invalid)   
- **Feeds:** [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md)
