# AI Project (Claude Project, ChatGPT Project)   
The specific computational container that stores accumulated journals, enabling cross-temporal pattern recognition.   
Creates a **Persistent Semantic Network**. It allows the AI to search across conversations, connect ideas from different contexts, and recognize patterns that emerge slowly over time.   
The [Journal](journal.md) is the content; the Project is the **storage infrastructure** that enables AI to perform cross-temporal pattern recognition.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Journal](journal.md)** (Relation: `Stores`).   
- Link to [AI](ai.md) (Relation: Container Within / Feature Of).
