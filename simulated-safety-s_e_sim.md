# Simulated Safety (S\_e\_sim)   
The dangerous illusion of safety provided by AI's non-judgment and fluency. Unlike real safety ([$S\_e$](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md)), it collapses the challenge gap rather than holding it.   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[$S\_e$](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) (Emotional Scaffolding)** (Relation: `Mimics`).   
- Link to **[Subject Supposed to Know](subject-supposed-to-know-sss.md)** (Relation: `Reinforces`).   
   
**Notes:** Fake emotional holding produced by AI fluency; collapses challenge gap.
