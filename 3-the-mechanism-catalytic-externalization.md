# 3. The Mechanism: Catalytic Externalization   
Notebook 5 initially framed AI's value as "Combinatorial" or "Synthesizing". We have upgraded this to Catalytic.   
- The Limitation of "Scaffolding": Scaffolding implies the AI builds the structure.   
- The Reality of "Catalysis": In high-functioning sessions, the AI provides the specific linguistic reagent that causes the user's own implicit, suspended knowledge to suddenly crystallize.   
- Bion's Connection: The AI generates the "[Selected Fact](selected-fact.md)"—the unifying concept that organizes chaotic beta-elements into a coherent whole. The [AI](ai.md) does not have the insight; it precipitates the insight in the [Human](human.md).
