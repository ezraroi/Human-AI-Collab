# 7. Translation: Existing Practice as Methodology   
### The Gap   
Sophisticated verification exists within practice but isn't articulated in methodological vocabulary.   
### The Translation   
|                                               |                                                                  |
|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                 Practice Term |                                        Methodological Equivalent |
|                       Felt-sense verification |                               Phenomenological validity criteria |
|               Grounding in real-life examples |                                              Ecological validity |
|          Temporal persistence across sessions |                                          Test-retest reliability |
| 4Ps Protocol (Pause, Probe, Process, Possess) | Structured verification procedure with built-in reflection loops |
|             Embodied checking during dialogue |                                   Concurrent validity assessment |
|             Cross-session pattern recognition |                                Longitudinal consistency analysis |

The Implication: The 4Ps Protocol IS the methodology operationalized, not separate from it. The methodology chapter must articulate this explicitly.
