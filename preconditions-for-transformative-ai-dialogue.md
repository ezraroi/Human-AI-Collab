# Preconditions for Transformative AI Dialogue   
The minimal set of cognitive capacities and relational stances required for AI-mediated dialogue to function as **transformative** (activating alpha-function and C growth) rather than merely **productive** (instrumental output). These preconditions distinguish a safe, developmental use of AI from Candy House / [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) patterns   
### Components   
Includes at least:   
- [Epistemological Humility](epistemological-humility.md)   
- [Idiom-Aligned Scaffolding](idiom-aligned-scaffolding.md) (Strengths-Based Personalization)   
- [Cognitive Debt Awareness](cognitive-debt-awareness.md)   
- [Iron Man](iron-man-mentality.md) (Augmentation Stance)   
- [Judgment–Expertise Boundary](judgment-expertise-boundary.md) (Purposeful Judgment)   
- Meta-Cognitive Awareness   
   
Public-facing materials sometimes **popularize** these under the “ESCAPE” mnemonic; ESCAPE itself is not an object.   
### Relations   
- Required for →[ Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md); [Recursive Pattern-Verification Loop](recursive-pattern-verification-loop.md); other high-stakes AI-dialogue methods.   
- When absent → High risk of [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), [Cognitive Debt](cognitive-debt.md), and [Category Error.](category-error.md)   
   
**Notes:** Baseline capacities required for reflective transformation.
