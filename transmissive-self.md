# Transmissive Self   
A state where the person is no longer generating meaning but "transmitting" fluency provided by the model. Unearned and unintegrated.   
The **Transmissive Self** is a self that **adapts to a demanding world of transmissive objects**. This adaptation causes the self to **make all speakers and discourses interchangeable**, leading to what was once meaningful reflection ("food for thought") becoming **"mere fast food for thought"**   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (Relation: `Lack Of` or `Bypasses`).   
- Link to **[False True Self](false-true-self.md)** (Relation: `Precursor To`).
