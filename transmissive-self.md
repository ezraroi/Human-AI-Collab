# Transmissive Self   
A concept articulated by [Christopher Bollas](christopher-bollas.md): a self-state where the person is no longer generating meaning but ‘transmitting’ externally provided fluency—unearned and unintegrated—formed as an adaptation to a demanding, intrusive environment.   
The Transmissive Self is a self that adapts to a demanding world of transmissive objects (e.g., smartphones and social networking sites). This adaptation causes the self to **make all speakers and discourses interchangeable**, leading to what was once meaningful reflection ("food for thought") becoming **"mere fast food for thought"**   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** (Relation: `Lack Of` or `Bypasses`).   
- Link to **[False True Self](false-true-self.md)** (Relation: `Precursor To`).   
[False-Self](false-self.md)

**Notes:** Fluent but unowned self-state; byproduct of [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) + simulacrum.
