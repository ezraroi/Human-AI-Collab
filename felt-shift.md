# Felt Shift   
A **Felt Shift** is a distinct, physical sensation of release or change within the body that occurs when an implicit, unclear bodily awareness (the "felt sense") is accurately articulated or understood.   
It is characterized by:   
• **A Physical Release:** It is experienced as a palpable "loosening," "coming unstuck," or "uncramping" in the body, often accompanied by a deep breath or a sigh of relief.   
• **A Change in Meaning:** The shift signals that the body-mind has moved a step forward; the problem or situation is physically felt differently, often opening up new possibilities or perspectives that logic alone could not provide.   
• **Resonance:** It typically happens when a word, image, or thought matches the felt sense perfectly (resonates), causing the body to signal "Yes, that is it"   
**Notes:** Event-like somatic confirmation that meaning matched.
