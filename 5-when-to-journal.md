# 5. When to Journal   
Not every conversation needs a [Journal](journal.md) entry. The system doesn't require constant inscription.   
The question is simple:   
Did something crystallize? Did verification loops converge on something worth carrying forward?   
If yes → Journal. If no → conversation history may be enough.   
### When Journaling Is Required   
[Identity Stakes](identity-stakes.md) work:   
- Material that touches who you are, not just what you know   
- Questions about direction, values, self-understanding   
- Insights that would change how you see yourself   
   
Durable accumulation needed:   
- You'll want to return to this   
- It connects to a longer arc of development   
- Losing it would mean re-processing the same ground later   
   
Something actually shifted:   
- There was a felt-shift during the work   
- You articulated something you couldn't articulate before   
- The conversation changed something, not just clarified it   
   
### When Journaling Is Optional   
Proximity Passes:   
- You got closer to something without arriving   
- Increased contact, reduced distance, but no discrete insight   
- Useful work, but nothing crystallized yet   
   
Light processing:   
- Information gathering, not transformation   
- Problem-solving that doesn't touch identity   
- Tasks where the output IS the deliverable   
   
Exploration without resolution:   
- You're circling something, not landing   
- The conversation was generative but diffuse   
- You'll return to this — now isn't the moment to fix it   
   
For these, the conversation history itself can serve as weak substrate for re-entry. Less durable than a [Journal](journal.md) entry, but sufficient for non-identity work.   
### The Decision Gate   
Ask yourself:   
1. Did something crystallize? (Not "did I learn something" — did something settle?)   
2. Does this carry Identity Stakes? (Would losing it cost me developmentally?)   
3. Will I need to return? (Is this part of a longer arc?)   
   
If any answer is clearly yes → make an entry. If all are no or unclear → let it rest. You can always return later if it turns out to matter.   
### The Risk of Over-Journaling   
Forcing inscription when nothing has crystallized produces pseudo-entries:   
- Writing to "capture" what you don't yet own   
- Entries that feel obligatory, not alive   
- Accumulating volume without depth   
   
This corrupts the substrate. Better to have fewer entries that are real than many that are hollow.   
### The Risk of Under-Journaling   
Skipping inscription when something DID crystallize:   
- Insight fades within days   
- You rediscover the same realization months later   
- No accumulation, no pattern recognition   
- Episodic cycling rather than developmental trajectory   
   
The cost isn't immediate. It's cumulative. You don't notice what you lost — you just keep re-processing the same ground.   
### Practical Heuristic   
If you're unsure, ask: "If I don't write this now, will I have to work through it again?"   
If yes — write. If no — let it go.
