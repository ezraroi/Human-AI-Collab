# Implementation Guidance   
### When to [Journal](journal.md)   
After significant dialogue:   
- Not every conversation needs journaling   
- When something crystallized   
- When you discovered rather than discussed   
- When verification loops converged on insight   
   
When you need to understand:   
- Not when you already understand   
- When feeling/observation needs articulation   
- When stuck and need to see differently   
- When pattern feels present but invisible   
   
When transformation is happening:   
- Identity-level shifts   
- Long-held beliefs changing   
- New ways of seeing emerging   
- Developmental leaps occurring   
   
### How to Journal (The Method)   
1. Start with what's actually true:   
- Not what should be   
- Not what sounds good   
- What you actually feel/think/notice   
2. Engage reflective prompting:   
- Question yourself   
- Challenge assumptions   
- Find real examples   
- Test against body   
- Iterate until convergence   
3. Write to discover:   
- Not to record what you know   
- But to understand what you don't   
- Let writing reveal   
- Follow where truth leads   
4. Verify continuously:   
- Does this feel spacious or tight?   
- Can I ground this in real experience?   
- Is this me or performance?   
- Am I avoiding something?   
5. Distill to essence:   
- What actually matters here?   
- What survived all verification?   
- What do I need to remember?   
- What enables future pattern recognition?   
6. Store in Project:   
- Make it accessible to AI   
- Enable cross-temporal synthesis   
- Create pattern recognition substrate   
- Build transformation infrastructure   
   
### What Makes a "Good" Journal Entry   
Not length. Not polish. Not insight density.   
But:   
- Honest (actually true for you)   
- Verified (survived embodied + cognitive checking)   
- Yours (your language, your encoding)   
- Useful (enables future pattern recognition)   
- Integrated (both channels engaged)   
   
A three-sentence entry that captures verified insight is better than a thousand-word reflection that circles without landing.
