# 8. CRITICAL CONNECTION #6: My Method Works Because It Engages Both Channels   
### My [Reflective Prompting ](reflective-prompting.md)Method   
1. Start with YOUR felt sense ([Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) active)   
2. Articulate it as prompt ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) active)   
3. AI provides challenge/mirror (maintains \|D-C\|)   
4. YOU hold the tension ([S\_e](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) - your container)   
5. Check response against felt sense (Channel 1 verification)   
6. Write integration in [journal](journal.md) (both channels engaged in materialization)   
   
### Why This Works   
From NoteBook 1 perspective:   
- Keeps AI in proper role (Piagetian Object/tool)   
- Activates YOUR [alpha function](alpha-function.md) (you're the container)   
- Maintains optimal \|D-C\| (productive tension)   
- Journal provides chronotope/continuity as the **materialization layer**   
   
From NoteBook 2 perspective:   
- Dialogue format activates social cognition systems   
- Anticipation creates embodied preparation states   
- Reflection engages interoceptive awareness   
- Writing integrates motor and semantic processing   
   
THE SYNTHESIS: My method succeeds because it forces both channels to work together:   
- Prevents bypass of [felt sense](felt-sense.md) verification by requiring Channel 1 check-ins   
- Can't avoid semantic articulation (Channel 2 required)   
- [Journal](journal.md) materialization recruits Channel 2 articulation and enables Channel 1 re-checking through return to the durable trace.   
- Completed [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md) cycles strengthen your [capacity](c-capacity.md) (C) over time when integration reaches crystallization → materialization → re-entry as a new baseline.
