# Channel 1 (Embodied / Sensorimotor Pathway)   
Channel 1 is the **embodied, sensorimotor, interoceptive pathway** through which the mind evaluates experience via somatic, affective, and temporal signals.   
It provides **friction, pacing, and affective response** to symbolic material and is accessible **only through the human body**.   
### System Role   
- Supplies the **necessary friction** that prevents passive semantic consumption.   
- Enables **metabolic digestion** of symbolic material through embodied response.   
- Governs **ownership formation** (“does this integrate into my self-structure?”).   
- Serves as the **verification layer** for transformation-related material (identity, meaning, coherence).   
- Works in **recursive oscillation** with [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) during [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) processing.   
   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Theorists:** [Gendlin](eugene-gendlin.md) ([Felt Sense](felt-sense.md)); [Piaget](jean-piaget.md) (Sensorimotor schema); [Damasio](antonio-damasio.md) ([Somatic Markers](somatic-marker-hypothesis.md) / [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)).   
- **Biological Substrate:** [Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md); Interoceptive network; Somatic Marker circuitry.   
- **Formula Link:**   
    - Supports **Sₑ** ([Emotional Scaffolding](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md)) by enabling pacing and emotional containment.   
    - Influences [**C** (Capacity)](c-capacity.md) by determining when symbolic material becomes *owned meaning*.   
    - Governs part of the metabolic loop constrained by **\|D – C\|**, as friction defines actual difficulty.
