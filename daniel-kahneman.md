# Daniel Kahneman   
According to Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman in his influential book Thinking, Fast and Slow, our minds are governed by two distinct systems([System 1](system-1.md)  and [System 2](system-2.md) ). Understanding how they work is the first step toward more deliberate learning and decision-making.   
   
Kahneman's work integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, for which he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002.   
- **Prospect Theory:** Developed with Amos Tversky, prospect theory explains how individuals make decisions under uncertainty and risk, suggesting that people are more sensitive to potential losses than they are to equivalent potential gains (known as "loss aversion").   
- **Heuristics and Biases:** Their work identified several "mental shortcuts" (heuristics) that often lead to predictable errors (biases) in judgment, such as the availability heuristic and the anchoring effect.   
- **"Thinking, Fast and Slow":** In his best-selling 2011 book, Kahneman summarized decades of research by describing the "two systems" that drive how we think: System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional, while System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical.   
- **Hedonic Psychology:** He also researched well-being and happiness, exploring the difference between the "experiencing self" and the "remembering self".   
   
**Legacy**   
Kahneman's research fundamentally changed multiple fields, including economics, psychology, and public policy, earning him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013. He was a professor emeritus at Princeton University at the time of his death on March 27, 2024, at the age of 90.
