# Time   
**Operates on two scales**   
- Short-term: [S\_e](s_e-emotional-scaffolding.md) recovery (within/between sessions)   
- Long-term: [C](c-capacity.md) integration and evolution (actual developmental change)   
   
**Notes:** Time is the medium that allows consolidation and C-growth; not a mechanism itself but the **temporal scaffold**.   
[Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md)
