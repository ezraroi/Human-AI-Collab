# HSCED (Hermeneutic Single-Case Efficacy Design)   
An established qualitative research methodology for rigorous single-case studies, particularly in psychotherapy research. Provides systematic framework for addressing the **"Biased Observer Problem"** where researcher is also the subject—the core methodological challenge in N=1 transformation research.   
HSCED creates rigor through **systematic adjudication**: cross-examining mixed-method data to generate plausible arguments that change occurred and ruling out alternative explanations.   
**The Problem It Solves:**   
**Biased Observer in N=1 Research:**   
- Researcher = Subject = Observer = Theorist   
- Risk of confirmation bias (seeing only what supports theory)   
- Self-reporting without external verification   
- Inability to distinguish genuine insight from self-deception   
   
**Without systematic methodology:** Single-case transformation research lacks credibility, appears anecdotal, cannot distinguish valid patterns from confabulation.   
**Roi's Application (Three Mechanisms):**   
**1. Cross-Examination of Mixed-Method Data:**   
- **Journal logs** (phenomenological, first-person)   
- **Chat logs** (dialogical, process documentation)   
- **Temporal density** substituting for breadth (43 notebooks over 8 months)   
- Triangulation between sources prevents single-source bias   
   
**2. The Skeptical Prosecutor (AI as Adjudicator):**   
- AI positioned to **challenge** interpretations, not confirm them   
- Actively seeks alternative explanations   
- Tests claims against counter-evidence   
- Forces explicit articulation of reasoning   
- **Innovation:** Using AI itself as methodological skeptic   
   
**3. Negative Case Analysis:**   
- Systematic documentation of **failures**   
- **Manic Episode** as critical counter-evidence   
- Moments where formula didn't operate as predicted   
- Boundary condition violations   
- **Prevents:** Cherry-picking only successful transformations   
   
**What HSCED Governs:**   
**Observation Rigor:**   
- How Human (researcher-subject) observes transformation   
- Standards for claiming genuine change vs. self-deception   
- Requirements for valid single-case conclusions   
- Adjudication process for competing interpretations   
   
**Methodological Claims Enabled:**   
- **Analytic generalization** to theory (not statistical to population)   
- **Temporal density** as substitute for cross-case frequency   
- **Idiographic control** (individual as own comparison)   
- **Plausible causal arguments** (not definitive proof)   
   
**What HSCED Does NOT Do:**   
- Enable population-level statistical inference   
- Prove generalizability to other cases   
- Replace need for eventual multi-case validation   
- Eliminate all observer bias (only systematizes it)   
   
**Notes:**   
HSCED is not Roi's invention—it's an established methodology he **applied** to AI-mediated transformation research. The innovation is using AI itself as the "skeptical prosecutor" within HSCED framework, creating a methodological loop where the transformation medium also serves as verification mechanism.   
Critical distinction: HSCED is **META** (about the research process) not part of the **SYSTEM** (Human + Journal + AI + Time). It governs how the researcher observes the system, not how the system operates.   
Limitation explicitly acknowledged: HSCED enables rigorous N=1 conclusions but does NOT enable population-level statistical inference. Future work requires multi-case replication to claim broader generalizability.
