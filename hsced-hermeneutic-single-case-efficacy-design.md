# HSCED (Hermeneutic Single-Case Efficacy Design)   
The methodological framework used to solve the "Biased Observer Problem" (where the researcher is also the subject). It creates rigor through **Systematic Adjudication**.   
**Core Components:**   
1. **Cross-examination:** Using mixed-method data (Journal logs + Chat logs).   
2. **The Skeptical Prosecutor:** Using the **[AI](https://www.google.com/search?q=ai.md)** to challenge the user's interpretations rather than confirm them.   
3. **Negative Case Analysis:** Actively documenting failures and "manic episodes" as counter-evidence.   
   
**Relations:**   
- Link to **[Human](human.md)** (Relation: `Governs Observation By`).   
- Link to **[Boundary Condition (The Manic Episode)](boundary-condition-the-manic-episode.md)**  (Relation: `analyzes`).
