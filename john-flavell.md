# John Flavell   
John H. Flavell was a world-renowned American developmental psychologist and the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Psychology, Emeritus, at Stanford University. He is widely considered the **founder of metacognition theory** and is credited with coining the term "metacognition" (thinking about thinking).   
His key contributions include:   
- **[Metacognition](metacognition.md) and Metamemory:** He defined metacognitive knowledge (knowledge about oneself as a learner, tasks, and strategies) and metacognitive experiences, highlighting their crucial role in effective learning and self-regulation.   
- **Theory of Mind:** Flavell conducted extensive research on the development of children's understanding of mental states, such as perception, perspective-taking, and consciousness.   
- **Appearance vs. Reality:** His famous studies assessed children's ability to distinguish how an object looks from what it actually is, finding that older four-year-olds and five-year-olds succeed on these tasks while three-year-olds often fail.   
- **[Piaget](jean-piaget.md)'s Work:** His 1963 book, *The Developmental Psychology of Jean Piaget*, was the first major work in English on Piaget's theories and research, helping to popularize the Swiss psychologist's ideas in American psychology.   
   
Flavell received numerous honors, including the American Psychological Association's Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions and election to the National Academy of Sciences. He died on March 13, 2025, at the age of 96.
