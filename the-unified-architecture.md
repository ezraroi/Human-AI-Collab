# The Unified Architecture   
A multi-view atlas of the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system: a routing map that relates complementary architectural lenses and points to the specialized objects that carry each view. Not an encyclopedia but a navigation instrument.   
Primary function: Answer four questions in under 60 seconds:   
1. Where am I? (View 3: State Space)   
2. Is this viable? (View 2: Runtime Stack)   
3. What scale am I working at? (View 4: Temporal Grain)   
4. What's the next safe move? (View 5: Developmental Availability + Navigation Rules)   
   
### Legend: Invariants (Must Hold Across All Views)   
These are non-negotiable constraints. If any invariant fails, the system is architecturally compromised.

### The Six Views   
### View 1 — Components (The Tetrad)   
Question: What is the system made of?   
Core Insight: Not a Human-AI dyad but a four-component recursive system.   
|             Component |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Function |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     [Human](human.md) |                                                                                                                                                                                                       Container (Sₑ), Alpha-Function, authorship, verification |

### View 2 — Runtime Stack (Operational Levels)   
Question: What must hold for the mechanism to run?   
Division of labor: View 2 describes the dependency hierarchy (what must be true). View 3 describes current configuration (what is happening now).   
Core Insight: Lower levels must be viable for upper levels to function. If Level 1 fails, Levels 2–4 cannot operate correctly.   
| Level |             Domain |                                                                              Key Function |
|:------|:-------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1 | Relational Posture |                                                      DTO stance, epistemological humility |
|     2 |   Field Conditions |                                                     (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ) calibrated to mismatch(D,C) |
|     3 |  Recursive Process |                                  [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) via C1 ↔ C2 coupling |
|     4 |       Accumulation |   [Materialization](materialization.md) + Time → durable [Capacity](c-capacity.md) growth |

The Mechanism (Levels 3–4):   
The [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md) (RML) is the engine of development: unresolved material enters → metabolic processing (Alpha-Function via C1 ↔ C2) → crystallization (owned insight stabilizes) → materialization (inscription in a durable substrate) → re-entry as a new capacity baseline.   
Temporal scale: across sessions/days (not moment-to-moment oscillation, which is Alpha-Function operating within the ICB).   
Materialization is constitutive but domain-variable:   
- [Identity stakes](identity-stakes.md) → Journal entry   
- Professional work → code / solution / internalized skill   
- Creative work → artifact / completed piece   
   
The Journal is the paradigmatic substrate for identity-level transformation.   
Key distinction: Transformation = RML completed. Productivity = Alpha-Function engaged without full cycle completion.

- To act: [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md) (when Level 2 fails), [4Ps Protocol](4ps-protocol.md) (Level 3 verification), Coherence Flywheel (self-diagnosis: "where am I in the cycle?")   
- To act: [Readiness Probes](readiness-probes.md) (assess Layer 1/2 viability), [Cognitive Mirror](cognitive-mirror-protege-mode.md) (scaffold Layer 2)   
   
### View 3 — State Space (Configuration Snapshot)   
Question: Where am I right now?   
Division of labor: View 3 describes current configuration (diagnostic snapshot). View 2 describes the dependency hierarchy (what must hold for the system to run).   
Core Insight: Two orthogonal axes determine current system state. Both must be in success mode for transformation to occur.   
|           Axis |                 Tracks |         Healthy State |                                  Failed State |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| A (Relational) |         How AI is held |        DTO maintained |                Subject drift (Category Error) |
|  B (Metabolic) | Whether Alpha operates | Metabolization active | [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) / Overwhelm |

- To act: [Touch Grass Protocol](touch-grass-protocol.md) (Axis A or B collapse), Iron Man Mentality (Axis A maintenance)   
   
### View 4 — Temporal Grain (Scale)   
Question: At what temporal resolution is the phenomenon operating?   
Core Insight: Different architectural elements operate at different scales. This dimension is orthogonal to the Runtime Stack — you can be at any operational level while observing phenomena at any temporal grain.   
| Grain |           Scope |                                      Key Object |                            What to Look For |
|:------|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Micro |   Per-utterance |   [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) | Turn-by-turn difference, productive tension |
|  Meso | Per-interaction | [Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md) |         Session-level dialogical legitimacy |
| Macro |   Cross-session |                              Third Intelligence |  Diachronic transformation, Capacity growth |

Note: RML operates at the Macro grain as the mechanism that produces durable growth via materialization + re-entry; it is routed through View 2 (Levels 3–4).

- To act: (If macro-level issue → View 2 Levels 3–4)   
   
### View 5 — Developmental Availability   
Question: Is this capacity online yet? What's the next achievable move?   
Core Insight: The architecture has prerequisites. Not all capacities are universally available; they come online through developmental achievement. The system presupposes internalized holding (post-Winnicottian territory).   
Prerequisites (what must be internalized):   
|                                                  Prerequisite |                                     What It Enables |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|     [Holding Environment ](holding-environment.md)(Winnicott) |                                        Sₑ viability |
| [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) ([Bion](wilfred-bion.md)) |                                  Metabolic capacity |
| [Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) |   Post-interpersonal Sₑ preservation in AI contexts |

Sequence (how it comes online):   
|    Stage Range |                                                                                                        Achievement |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Stages 1–6 |                                                                                Holding Environment (Sₑ stabilizes) |
|        Stage 7 |                                                                            DTO usable under strain (Use of Object) |
|    Stages 8–10 |                                                                               Metabolic capacity becomes available |
|   Stages 11–12 | Transformation mechanism operates (Stage 11: Alpha-Function activates; Stage 12: Materialization and verification) |
|       Stage 13 |                                                                                         Destiny Drive articulation |

Activation Conditions (User-Level Assessment):   
View 5 describes system-internal developmental prerequisites. Activation Conditions extends this to user-level accessibility:   
| Zone | Layer 1 (Holding) | Layer 2 (Verification) |                       System Response |
|:-----|:------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------|
|    A |   Below threshold |                    N/A | Out-of-scope for identity-stakes work |
|    B |            Viable |          Initially low |       Scaffoldable (Cognitive Mirror) |
|    C |            Viable |           Already high |                          Native match |

### View 6 — Failure Taxonomy   
Question: What is failing? What does collapse look like here?   
Core Insight: Failure modes are diagnostically specific. Each names which constraint is failing. Correct diagnosis enables targeted intervention.   
Primary Failure Modes (root constraint failures):   
|              Failure Mode |                 What Fails |           Collapse Pattern |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|
| PSB (Protein Shake Brain) |    Metabolization bypassed | C2 without C1 verification |
|            Category Error |       DTO stance collapses |      AI treated as Subject |
|      Cognitive Dependency |        Both above co-occur |       Category Error + PSB |
|                 Overwhelm |     Sₜ exceeds Sₑ capacity |    Beta-flooding, shutdown |

Failure Drivers (precipitating conditions that increase primary failure risk):   
|                 Driver |             What Degrades |   Increases Risk Of |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------|
| Sycophancy / Mirroring | Functional Alterity fails | Category Error, PSB |
|           Sₑ Depletion |      Containment capacity |      Overwhelm, PSB |

### Correspondence Layers (Non-Architectural)   
These are not peer views but mapping layers — how the architecture corresponds to other domains. They do not determine system operation but provide translation frames.   
### Layer A — Interior Phenomenology   
What it is: What the mechanism feels like from inside; theoretical anchors and practitioner-facing translations.   
Theoretical Anchors:   
|        Layer |  Theorist |                                          Experience |
|:-------------|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|   Foundation | Winnicott |           Ontological security, continuity-of-being |
|   Processing |      Bion |     β → α transformation, thinking becomes possible |
| Verification |   Gendlin |       "Spacious vs. tight" — embodied truth-testing |
|   Expression |    Bollas |                 "This is mine" — idiom articulation |

Practitioner Translation:   
The [Coherence Flywheel](coherence-flywheel.md) provides phenomenological markers for the Recursive Metabolic Loop (RML):

### Notes   
UA does not explain the objects — it locates them. For content, follow the routes.   
Routing discipline:   
- If you need to understand → route to concept object   
- If you need to act → route to protocol/method object   
   
Stability principle: UA stays stable as specialized objects evolve. Update UA only when:   
- A new view is needed (rare)   
- Routing changes (object renamed/merged/split)   
- A new invariant is discovered
