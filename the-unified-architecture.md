# The Unified Architecture   
The convergence of all layers (Psychological, Dialogical, Embodied, Biological) into a single cohesive model.   
|                                      **Conceptual Layer** |                                                                                                                                                                                                     **Mechanism/Function** |                                                                                                                  **Corresponding Brain Systems** |
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      I. Foundation/Safety ([Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md)) | [Holding Environment ](holding-environment.md)(operationalized as [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md)) provides Ontological Security and continuity-of-being by removing annihilation/impingement threat |                                                           Physiological [HPA-Axis](hpa-axis.md) Regulation (The requisite biological stability). |
|         II. Processing/Thinking ([Bion](wilfred-bion.md)) |                                                                                                     [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) metabolizes raw experience (Beta-elements) into usable knowledge (Alpha-elements). |               [Triple Network Model ](triple-network-model.md)(DMN, FPN, SN) actively coordinating task execution and self-referential material. |
| III. Feedback/Verification ([Gendlin](eugene-gendlin.md)) |                                                                                                                [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) (spacious vs. tight) provides embodied verification of internal persuasiveness. | [Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC)](anterior-insular-cortex-aic.md) (a plausible correlate for interoceptive integration associated with Felt Sense) |
|   IV. Expression/Agency ([Bollas](christopher-bollas.md)) |                                                                                     [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) becomes phenomenologically articulated, translating the unthought known into lived idiom expression. |                      Practice-Dependent Neuroplasticity and Systems Consolidation (creating stable, long-term identity change in the neocortex). |

**Notes:** The convergence of all layers: safety, processing, verification, agency.
