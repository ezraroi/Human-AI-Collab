# The Unified Architecture   
A multi-view atlas of the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system: a routing map that relates complementary architectural lenses and points to the specialized objects that carry each view. Not an encyclopedia but a navigation instrument.   
**Primary function:** Answer four questions in under 60 seconds:   
1. Where am I? (View 3: State Space)   
2. Is this viable? (View 2: Runtime Stack)   
3. What scale am I working at? (View 4: Temporal Grain)   
4. What's the next safe move? (View 5: Developmental Availability + Navigation Rules)   
   
### Legend: Invariants (Must Hold Across All Views)   
These are non-negotiable constraints. If any invariant fails, the system is architecturally compromised.

## The Six Views   
### View 1 — Components (The Tetrad)   
**Question:** What is the system made of?   
**Core Insight:** Not a Human-AI dyad but a four-component recursive system.   
| Component |                                                                                             Function |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Human |    [Container](the-container.md) (Sₑ), [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md), authorship, verification |
|   Journal | [Chronotope](chronotope.md), [materialization](materialization.md), cross-temporal pattern substrate |
|        AI |          Sₜ, [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md), constraint-generation (when held as DTO) |
|      Time |                                                                Recovery, consolidation, accumulation |

**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* Third Intelligence, Human, AI, Journal, Time   
- *To act:* (Components view is structural; action routes through other views)   
   
### View 2 — Runtime Stack (Operational Levels)   
**Question:** What must hold for the mechanism to run?   
**Division of labor:** View 2 describes the *dependency hierarchy* (what must be true). View 3 describes *current configuration* (what is happening now).   
**Core Insight:** Lower levels must be viable for upper levels to function. If Level 1 fails, Levels 2–4 cannot operate correctly.   
| Level |             Domain |                                                        Key Function |
|:------|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1 | Relational Posture | DTO stance, [epistemological humility](epistemological-humility.md) |
|     2 |   Field Conditions |                               (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ) calibrated to mismatch(D,C) |
|     3 |  Recursive Process |                                 Alpha-Function via C1 ↔ C2 coupling |
|     4 |       Accumulation |                    Materialization + Time → durable Capacity growth |

**The Mechanism (Levels 3–4):**   
The **[Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md) (RML)** is the engine of development: **unresolved material** enters → **metabolic processing** (Alpha-Function via C1 ↔ C2) → **crystallization** (owned insight stabilizes) → **materialization** (inscription in a durable substrate) → **re-entry** as a new capacity baseline.   
**Temporal scale:** across sessions/days (not moment-to-moment oscillation, which is Alpha-Function operating within the ICB).   
**Materialization is constitutive but domain-variable:**   
- [Identity stakes](identity-stakes.md) → Journal entry   
- Professional work → code / solution / internalized skill   
- Creative work → artifact / completed piece   
    The Journal is the paradigmatic substrate for identity-level transformation.   
   
**Key distinction:** *Transformation* = RML completed. *Productivity* = Alpha-Function engaged without full cycle completion.   
**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* Field Viability Schema, [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md), [Recursive Metabolic Loop](recursive-metabolic-loop.md), Alpha-Function   
- *To act:* [Touch Grass Protocol ](touch-grass-protocol.md)(when Level 2 fails), 4Ps Protocol (Level 3 verification), [Coherence Flywheel ](coherence-flywheel.md)(self-diagnosis: “where am I in the cycle?”)   
   
### View 3 — State Space (Configuration Snapshot)   
**Question:** Where am I right now?   
**Division of labor:** View 3 describes *current configuration* (diagnostic snapshot). View 2 describes the *dependency hierarchy* (what must hold for the system to run).   
**Core Insight:** Two orthogonal axes determine current system state. Both must be in success mode for transformation to occur.   
|           Axis |                 Tracks |         Healthy State |                                  Failed State |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| A (Relational) |         How AI is held |        DTO maintained |                Subject drift (Category Error) |
|  B (Metabolic) | Whether Alpha operates | Metabolization active | [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) / Overwhelm |

**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* [Two-Axis Framework](two-axis-framework.md), Category Error, PSB, [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- *To act:* Touch Grass Protocol (Axis A or B collapse), Iron Man Mentality (Axis A maintenance)   
   
### View 4 — Temporal Grain (Scale)   
**Question:** At what temporal resolution is the phenomenon operating?   
**Core Insight:** Different architectural elements operate at different scales. This dimension is orthogonal to the Runtime Stack — you can be at any operational level while observing phenomena at any temporal grain.   
| Grain |           Scope |                                      Key Object |                            What to Look For |
|:------|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Micro |   Per-utterance |   [Functional Alterity](functional-alterity.md) | Turn-by-turn difference, productive tension |
|  Meso | Per-interaction | [Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md) |         Session-level dialogical legitimacy |
| Macro |   Cross-session |                              Third Intelligence |  Diachronic transformation, Capacity growth |

**Note:** **RML operates at the Macro grain** as the *mechanism* that produces durable growth via **materialization + re-entry**; it is routed through View 2 (Levels 3–4).   
**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* Functional Alterity, Functional Thirdness, Third Intelligence   
- *To act:* (If macro-level issue → View 2 Levels 3–4)   
   
### View 5 — Developmental Availability   
**Question:** Is this capacity online yet? What’s the next achievable move?   
**Core Insight:** The architecture has prerequisites. Not all capacities are universally available; they come online through developmental achievement. The system presupposes internalized holding (post-Winnicottian territory).   
**Prerequisites (what must be internalized):**   
|                                                  Prerequisite |                                     What It Enables |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
|           Holding Environment ([Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md)) |                                        Sₑ viability |
|                      Alpha-Function ([Bion](wilfred-bion.md)) |                                  Metabolic capacity |
| [Protected Self-Holding](protected-self-holding-principle.md) |   Post-interpersonal Sₑ preservation in AI contexts |

**Sequence (how it comes online):**   
|    Stage Range |                                                     Achievement |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Stages 1–6 |   [Holding Environment](holding-environment.md) (Sₑ stabilizes) |
|        Stage 7 |                         DTO usable under strain (Use of Object) |
|    Stages 8–10 |                                Alpha-Function becomes available |
|   Stages 11–12 |               Transformation mechanism operates (RML completes) |
|       Stage 13 |                  [Destiny Drive](destiny-drive.md) articulation |

**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* [Developmental Sequence](developmental-sequence.md), [Psychoanalytic Prerequisites](psychoanalytic-prerequisites.md), Protected Self-Holding Principle   
- *To act:* (If prerequisite not online → professional support or developmental work outside system)   
   
### View 6 — Failure Taxonomy   
**Question:** What is failing? What does collapse look like here?   
**Core Insight:** Failure modes are diagnostically specific. Each names which constraint is failing. Correct diagnosis enables targeted intervention.   
**Primary Failure Modes (root constraint failures):**   
|              Failure Mode |                 What Fails |           Collapse Pattern |
|:--------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|
| PSB (Protein Shake Brain) |    Metabolization bypassed | C2 without C1 verification |
|            Category Error |       DTO stance collapses |      AI treated as Subject |
|      Cognitive Dependency |        Both above co-occur |       Category Error + PSB |
|                 Overwhelm |     Sₜ exceeds Sₑ capacity |    Beta-flooding, shutdown |

**Failure Drivers (precipitating conditions that increase primary failure risk):**   
|                 Driver |             What Degrades |   Increases Risk Of |
|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------|
| Sycophancy / Mirroring | Functional Alterity fails | Category Error, PSB |
|           Sₑ Depletion |      Containment capacity |      Overwhelm, PSB |

**Routes to →**   
- *To understand:* PSB, Category Error, Cognitive Dependency   
- *To act:* Touch Grass Protocol (when any primary failure detected)   
   
## Correspondence Layers (Non-Architectural)   
These are not peer views but mapping layers — how the architecture corresponds to other domains. They do not determine system operation but provide translation frames.   
### Layer A — Interior Phenomenology   
**What it is:** What the mechanism feels like from inside; theoretical anchors and practitioner-facing translations.   
**Theoretical Anchors:**   
|        Layer |                        Theorist |                                          Experience |

|   Expression | [Bollas](christopher-bollas.md) |                 "This is mine" — idiom articulation |

**Practitioner Translation:**   
The **Coherence Flywheel** provides phenomenological markers for the **Recursive Metabolic Loop (RML)**:   
| Flywheel Stage |                  RML Stage |                      Felt Experience |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
|          Spark | Unresolved material enters |                    “Something’s off” |
|          Spill |            Externalization |  Raw expression, β-material surfaces |
|         Mirror |       Metabolic processing |     Tension held; working it through |
|          Click |            Crystallization |          Felt shift; α-element forms |
|           Mark |            Materialization |          Inscription in durable form |
|         Recoil |                   Re-entry |         Return to life; new baseline |

## Notes   
**UA does not explain the objects — it locates them.** For content, follow the routes.   
**Routing discipline:**   
- If you need to *understand* → route to concept object   
- If you need to *act* → route to protocol/method object   
   
**Stability principle:** UA stays stable as specialized objects evolve. Update UA only when:   
- A new view is needed (rare)   
- Routing changes (object renamed/merged/split)   
- A new invariant is discovered
