# Two-Axis Framework   
The Two-Axis Framework is the **structural map** that organizes all success modes and failure modes in the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system.    
It consists of:   
### Axis A – Relational Ontology   
- **Goal:** Treat [AI](ai.md) as [DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) (Object).   
- **Failure:** [Category Error](category-error.md) (AI as Subject).   
   
### Axis B – Processing Mode   
- **Goal:** Recursive Metabolic Oscillation ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) ↔ [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md), metabolized by [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) cycles)   
- **Failure:** [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (Channel 2-only bypass).   
   
Together, the axes describe the full space of possible system states — from transformation to collapse.   
### System Role   
- Provides the diagnostic framework for evaluating human-AI interaction quality.   
- Describes how relational stance and cognitive processing jointly determine outcomes.   
- Anchors the definitions of [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md), [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md), and [Category Error.](category-error.md)   
- Acts as the top-level organizing schema for both theory and intervention.   
   
[The Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md) = the ***internal architecture of Axis B*.**   
- Axis A decides *whether* the system is safe/valid at all (if AI is held as DTO or not).   
- Axis B decides *how* experience is metabolized when the relational stance is correct.   
- The Integrated Circuit Board is **Axis B’s “wiring diagram”**:   
    - [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) = core processor / power regulator   
    - [As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) = bridge by which Channel 2 symbolic input recruits Channel 1 embodied evaluation/verification   
    - [Journal](journal.md) = external organ that stabilizes and re-injects processed material over Time   
   
So:   
> Two-Axis Framework →   

Axis A: *Who/What the AI is* (DTO vs Subject)   
Axis B: *How experience is processed* → **[Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md)**   
If Axis A fails (Category Error), **the system becomes relationally invalid**: AI becomes Subject, the experienced challenge in the [ZPD](zpd.md) collapses toward ‘no struggle,’ and **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) risk increases; when PSB co-occurs → [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)** (while the structural \|D−C\| relation remains pre-existing).   
### Wiring (Relations)   
- **Maps:**   
    - [Category Error](category-error.md)   
    - Protein Shake Brain ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md))   
    - [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Defines:** Systemic success vs. systemic collapse boundaries
