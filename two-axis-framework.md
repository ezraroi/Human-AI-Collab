# Two-Axis Framework   
**The Two-Axis Framework** is the structural map that organizes success modes and failure modes in the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) system.   
It consists of:   
### Axis A — Relational Ontology   
- **Goal:** Hold AI as **[DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) (Dynamic Transitional Object)** (i.e., not a Subject; not a “someone”).   
- **Failure:** **Category Error** (AI treated as Subject / epistemic authority / relational other).   
   
### Axis B — Processing Mode   
- **Goal:** **Recursive Metabolic Oscillation** (Channel 2 ↔ Channel 1), metabolized through **Alpha-Function** cycles.   
- **Failure:** **PSB** (Channel 2-only bypass; fluent coherence without embodied digestion).   
   
**Together, the axes describe the configuration space of system states — from transformation to collapse.**   
This plane operates within a **Viability Envelope** (**Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ calibrated to mismatch(D, C)**); when the envelope collapses, the configuration plane becomes **unstable** (drifts become harder to prevent; failure attractors become “sticky”).   
**[Functional Thirdness](functional-thirdness.md) episodes are only possible in the viable quadrant:** Axis A = DTO stance **and** Axis B = metabolic oscillation (within a viable Sₑ envelope).   
## System Role   
The Two-Axis Framework diagnoses **configuration**. Field Viability diagnoses **operability**. Developmental staging diagnoses **readiness**. All three are required for full system assessment.   
- Provides the diagnostic framework for evaluating human–AI interaction quality.   
- Describes how **relational stance** and **processing mode** jointly determine outcomes.   
- Anchors definitions of **Cognitive Dependency**, **PSB**, and **Category Error**.   
- Acts as a top-level organizing schema for both theory and intervention.   
   
## Axis B internal architecture   
[**The Integrated Circuit Board** ](the-integrated-circuit-board.md)is the internal architecture of Axis B:   
- **[Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md)** = core metabolic processor (metabolization through C1 ↔ C2 oscillation)   
- **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md)** = bridge that supports sustained C1 ↔ C2 coupling during symbolic work (embodied signal + symbolic refinement)   
- **[Journal](journal.md)** = **diachronic stabilization organ** that consolidates metabolized material over Time; **may be minimal in low-stakes interactions but is constitutive for identity-stakes transformation**.   
   
So:   
> Two-Axis Framework →   

**Axis A:** **How AI is held** ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) stance vs Subject misclassification)   
**Axis B:** How experience is processed → Integrated Circuit Board   
## Failure coupling (keep, but slightly tightened)   
If **Axis A fails** ([Category Error](category-error.md)), the system becomes **relationally invalid**: AI becomes Subject/authority, *verification discipline drops*, and **PSB risk increases**.   
When Category Error + [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) co-occur → [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md) (**experienced challenge loses developmental character**: authorship collapses and metabolization is bypassed).   
## Envelope constraint (explicit gating rule)   
**Do not introduce Sₜ (challenge / Functional Alterity) when Sₑ is collapsed.**   
Rebuild containment first, then reintroduce productive tension.   
## Whole-system one-liner (good; tiny tightening)   
The Third Intelligence system is a **configuration** (Axis A × Axis B) operating within a **viability envelope** (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ calibrated to mismatch), following a **developmental trajectory** (staging, depletion, recovery), with **shadow regions** marking pathological attractors and scope boundaries.   
## Wiring (Relations)   
- **Maps:** [Category Error](category-error.md); Protein Shake Brain ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)); [Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md)   
- **Operates within:** [Field Viability](field-viability-schema.md) (Viability Envelope)   
- **Evolves along:** Developmental Staging (trajectory/readiness layer)   
- **Defines:** systemic success vs systemic collapse boundaries   
- **Prerequisites Specified By:** [Developmental Sequence](developmental-sequence.md)   
- **Axis B Internal Architecture:** Integrated Circuit Board
