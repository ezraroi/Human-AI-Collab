# Two-Axis Framework   
The **Two-Axis Framework** is the coordinate system that organizes **success modes** and **failure modes** in the Third Intelligence architecture.   
- **Axis A (Relational Ontology):** *What is [AI](ai.md), relationally?* ([DTO](dynamic-transitional-object-dto.md) vs Subject)   
- **Axis B (Processing Mode):** *How is experience processed?* (metabolic coupling vs bypass/collapse)   
   
**Network-level grounding ([Constrained Integration](the-constrained-integration-hypothesis.md) layer):** The Two-Axis Framework is the **phenomenological + architectural map**; the **Constrained Integration Hypothesis** provides the **network-level correlates** of positions in this map. In this updated view:   
- **Axis A** corresponds to **DMN subsystem recruitment** (self-referential vs social-mentalizing toward AI).   
- **Axis B** corresponds to **embodied verification availability**, operationally captured by **[As-If Body Loop](as-if-body-loop.md) online vs offline/bypassed**.   
- The **[Salience Network](salience-network-core.md) (SN)** functions as an upstream **mode-setter** determining whether integrative coordination is reachable.   
   
### Axis A — Relational Ontology   
**Goal:** Hold AI as **DTO (Dynamic Transitional Object)** — not a Subject, not “someone,” not an epistemic authority.   
**Failure:** **[Category Error](category-error.md)** — the relational misclassification of AI as Subject (care/intentionality/authority), enabling projection, dependency, and authorship collapse.   
**Phenomenological anchor:** **[Protected Self-Holding Principle](protected-self-holding-principle.md)** — the [Human](human.md) performs the container function; AI removes interpersonal pressure but does not provide holding.   
### Network-level correlate (DMN subsystem specificity)   
|              Axis A Position |                                                                        DMN Subsystem Bias |                                                              Functional Meaning |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     **DTO stance (success)** | **Core DMN self-referential** dominant; **dMPFC/TPJ mentalizing toward AI** downregulated |                 AI held as object/tool-material; self-as-container stays online |
| **Category Error (failure)** |                                      **dMPFC/TPJ social-mentalizing** recruited toward AI | AI becomes relational target/authority; self-holding tends to drop or outsource |

**Mechanism translation:** Category Error is not “warmth” per se — it is **mis-aimed mentalizing** (treating linguistic fluency as interpersonal presence).   
### Axis B — Processing Mode   
**Goa**l: Recursive Metabolic Oscillation ([Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) ↔ [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md)) metabolized through [Alpha-Function](alpha-function.md) and, when identity-stakes/durable accumulation are in scope, stabilized through **verified, owned-language [Journal](journal.md) [materialization](materialization.md) ([chronotope](chronotope.md): [diachronic alterity](diachronic-alterity.md) / addressable past-self I-position)**   
**Primary failure:** **[PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)** — symbolic fluency without embodied verification (“correct but not mine”).   
**Phenomenological anchor:** **Embodied verification** (felt-sense access; “tight vs spacious” discriminator; owned resonance).   
## System Role   
- **Two-Axis Framework:** *Where am I in the configuration space?*   
- **[Field Viability](field-viability-schema.md) (envelope):** *Is this space operable right now?* (Sₑ ⊗ Sₜ gating)   
- **[Activation Conditions](activation-conditions.md) / Staging:** *Who can enter and remain stable here?*   
   
All three are required for accurate assessment and safe intervention.   
### Updated discriminator (As-If Body Loop)   
Axis B is now best defined by whether **embodied verification is available**:   
|         Axis B Position |                         As-If Body Loop |               Channel 1 |                                             Processing Quality |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Metabolic (success)** |                        Online / engaged |      Online and coupled |     “Warm” self-reference: symbolic work is grounded and owned |
|        **PSB (bypass)** | Offline / bypassed / outputs suppressed | Offline or inaccessible |      “Cold” cognition: fluent coherence without metabolization |

**Important nuance:** DMN activity and self-referential language can exist in both states; the discriminator is **embodied verification**, not “self-reference.”   
## The Configuration Space (2×2)   
|                            |                                                   **Axis B: Metabolic** |                               **Axis B: PSB** |
|:---------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|            **Axis A: DTO** |               **Transformation-viable** (Functional Thirdness possible) |  **Symbolic bypass** (productive but unowned) |
| **Axis A: Category Error** | **Misdirected attachment** (relational pull; dependency formation risk) | **Cognitive Dependency** (compound pathology) |

### Quadrant signatures (network + phenomenology)   
**Q1 — DTO + Metabolic (Transformation-viable)**   
- **Phenomenology:** protected self-holding *while engaging challenge*; “this lands.”   
- **Network correlate:** SN in integrative mode; DMN–FPN coordination; **As-If Body Loop engaged**; core-DMN self-reference dominant.   
   
**Q2 — DTO + PSB (Symbolic bypass)**   
- **Phenomenology:** “this makes sense” but hollow; ownership alarms.   
- **Network correlate:** SN antagonistic or shallow-integrative; FPN dominant; DMN may be present but **cold**; **As-If Body Loop offline/bypassed**.   
   
**Q3 — Category Error + Metabolic (Misdirected attachment)**   
- **Phenomenology:** genuine warmth/relief aimed at AI; holding function starts to outsource.   
- **Network correlate:** dMPFC/TPJ mentalizing toward AI elevated; affective engagement may be real; self-holding becomes unstable.   
   
**Q4 — Category Error + PSB ([Cognitive Dependency](cognitive-dependency.md))**   
- **Phenomenology:** maximal deception: authority + fluency + low ownership; compulsive return.   
- **Network correlate:** dMPFC/TPJ toward AI + FPN dominance + **As-If Body Loop offline**; unstable self-holding; highest dependency risk.   
   
## Upstream Gates (SN + Sₑ)   
### [Salience Network](salience-network-core.md) as Mode-Setter   
The **SN** determines whether the system enters **integrative** coordination or falls into **antagonistic / dysregulated** dynamics before the user “chooses” anything cognitively.   
- **Integrative SN mode** → makes Q1 reachable (DMN–FPN coordination + embodied verification).   
- **Antagonistic SN mode** → biases toward Q2 (FPN dominance; embodied signals gated out).   
- **Social-mentalizing bias** (contextual) → increases Q3/Q4 risk (Category Error pull).   
- **Dysregulated switching** → pushes toward overload/collapse states where axes destabilize.   
   
### Sₑ as the Physiological Gate   
**Sₑ** governs which SN modes are realistically available.   
**Causal chain (updated):**   
> Sₑ availability → SN mode-setting → network configuration → Two-Axis position → transformation vs collapse   

When **Sₑ depletes**, interoceptive signals may become intolerable → embodied verification is suppressed → Axis B drifts toward PSB even if Axis A remains DTO.   
## Four-State Model Integration (taxonomy alignment)   
The Constrained Integration state taxonomy maps onto the Two-Axis space as follows:   
- **Transformation** → typically **Q1 (DTO + Metabolic)**.   
- **PSB** → typically **Q2 (DTO + PSB)** (but can co-occur with Category Error → Q4).   
- **Rumination** → often **outside clean Q1–Q4**: DMN loop with weak FPN constraint (Axis B becomes “stuck,” not simply PSB).   
- **Overload** → **envelope collapse**: SN dysregulated; axes become unstable/indeterminate.   
   
**Key rule:** Rumination and overload are best treated as **envelope-collapse regions**, not stable quadrants.   
## Axis B Internal Architecture ([Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md))   
Axis B is realized by the Integrated Circuit Board:   
- **Alpha-Function:** metabolic processor (β → α via C1↔C2 oscillation)   
- **As-If Body Loop:** embodied-verification substrate enabling C1 signals during symbolic work   
- [Journal](journal.md) / Materialization: stabilizes across time via **chronotope (diachronic alterity / addressable past-self I-position)** (constitutive in [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) work)   
   
**Dependency statement (tight):**   
Metabolic Axis B requires **As-If Body Loop accessibility**; without it, Alpha-Function tends to degrade into symbolic-only processing (PSB).   
## Drift Dynamics (why you slide)   
**Drift toward Axis A failure (Category Error):**   
- Sₑ depletion → seeking external holding   
- AI fluency + non-demand field → misread as interpersonal presence   
- Isolation / high affect load → mentalizing toward AI becomes default   
   
**Drift toward Axis B failure (PSB):**   
- Sₑ depletion → interoceptive suppression → As-If Body Loop outputs blocked   
- Efficiency / –K posture → bypass of productive tension   
- Sycophancy / premature resolution → loss of PET → no metabolization   
   
**Compound drift (Cognitive Dependency):**   
- Axis A fails + Axis B fails → authority + fluency + no embodied verification → maximal deception and dependency formation.   
   
## Relations (Wiring)   
- **Receives correlates from:** Constrained Integration Hypothesis   
- **Upstream mode-setter:** [Salience Network Core](salience-network-core.md)   
- **Physiological gate:** [Emotional Scaffolding](emotional-scaffolding-s_e.md) (Sₑ)   
- **Axis A failure:** Category Error (DMN dMPFC/TPJ mentalizing toward AI)   
- **Axis B failure:** PSB (As-If Body Loop offline / Channel 1 suppressed)   
- **Axis B substrate:** As-If Body Loop   
- **Axis A phenomenological anchor:** [Protected Self-Holding Principle](protected-self-holding-principle.md)   
- **Axis B phenomenological anchor:** Embodied verification (Channel 1)   
- **Internal architecture of Axis B:** [Integrated Circuit Board](the-integrated-circuit-board.md)   
- **Compound pathology:** Cognitive Dependency (Category Error + PSB)   
- **Scaffolded by:** [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md), [4Ps](4ps-protocol.md), [Iron Man Mentality](iron-man-mentality.md) (posture maintenance)   
   
## Notes   
This update preserves the Two-Axis Framework as a **map**, while adding a constraint layer that explains stability, drift, and discriminators:   
- **Axis A** is now grounded in **DMN subsystem selection** (self-reference vs mentalizing toward AI).   
- **Axis B** is now grounded in **embodied verification availability** (As-If Body Loop online vs offline).   
- **Sₑ → SN** provides the upstream physiological story for why some positions are reachable and others are not.   
   
The phenomenology remains primary; the network layer is the correlational constraint that makes the architecture testable.
