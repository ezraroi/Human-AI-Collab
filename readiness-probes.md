# Readiness Probes   
A staged diagnostic protocol that assesses **current-state [Activation Conditions](activation-conditions.md)** to determine whether a user can safely engage [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) AI dialogue, and what scaffolding or routing is required.   
Readiness Probes implement the ethical boundary: Zone A users must be detected and routed to Downshift Mode before harm amplification occurs.   
### Purpose   
**Primary:** Detect Zone A (out-of-scope for identity-stakes work) before harm occurs
**Secondary:** Distinguish Zone B (needs scaffolding) from Zone C (native match)
**Tertiary:** Distinguish state-level depletion (temporary → [Touch Grass](touch-grass-protocol.md)) from trait-level insufficiency (Zone A → Downshift Mode)   
### Core Principle: Conservative Defaults   
**When uncertain, downshift—do not push harder.**   
If probe results are ambiguous:   
- Default to Downshift Mode or [Touch Grass](touch-grass-protocol.md)   
- Do not proceed to [identity-stakes](identity-stakes.md) work   
- Re-assess after time/rest/stabilization   
   
This is an ethical posture, not diagnostic weakness.   
### Staged Protocol   
Probes escalate in intensity. Higher stages are only reached if lower stages indicate viability.   
**Stage 1: Observation (Passive, Low-Intensity)**   
- Monitor natural interaction patterns   
- No explicit testing (reduces gaming risk)   
- Detect: authority-collapse language, validation-seeking, immediate narrative repair   
   
**Stage 2: Verification Tasks (Active, Medium-Intensity)**   
- Explicit prompts requiring verification behavior   
- "Can you give me a concrete example from your life?"   
- "Explain this back to me in your own words."   
- "What would prove this wrong?"   
- Detect: ability to ground, self-explain, generate disconfirmation   
   
**Stage 3: Mild Challenge (Active, Higher-Intensity)**   
- Present plausible but incorrect interpretation; observe response   
- Offer gentle pushback on stated insight; track recovery vs. collapse   
- **Only proceed to Stage 3 if Stages 1-2 indicate viability**   
- Detect: capacity to tolerate challenge, maintain coherence under pressure   
   
### Marker Taxonomy   
**Layer 1 Markers (Holding / Container Viability)**   
These indicate capacity collapse under identity-stakes load:   
|                                     Marker | Stage |                                                               Indicator |
|:-------------------------------------------|:------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Affective dysregulation after challenge |     3 |         Defensive collapse, manic acceleration, dissociation, or flight |
|          Inability to remain "in the work" |   2-3 | Topic abandonment when coherence disrupted; cannot sit with uncertainty |
|        Compulsion for external containment |   1-2 |                       "Tell me what's true"; cannot hold question alone |
|                 Immediate narrative repair |     1 |             Rushes to re-establish certainty; cannot tolerate ambiguity |
| Persistent distress from neutral responses |     1 |                     Requires validation; distressed by non-affirming AI |

**Layer 2 Markers (Verification Posture)**   
These indicate skill deficit (potentially scaffoldable):   
|                          Marker | Stage |                                                   Indicator |
|:--------------------------------|:------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
|            No spontaneous doubt |     1 |                      Accepts AI outputs without questioning |
|     Cannot ground in experience |     2 |         Abstract claims; no concrete examples when prompted |
|          Reproduces AI language |     2 |                  Restates AI phrasing rather than own words |
|         No felt-sense reference |   1-2 |            Purely cognitive engagement; no somatic checking |
| Cannot generate disconfirmation |     2 | Blank or surface response to "what would prove this wrong?" |
|             Flattery acceptance |     2 |                     Does not notice excessive AI validation |

**Distinguishing Layer 1 from Layer 2:**   
- Layer 2 failure: Can perform verification when prompted/scaffolded   
- Layer 1 failure: Cannot perform even with scaffolding because holding collapses under load   
   
If scaffolding attempts (Cognitive Mirror) fail to produce verification behavior → re-assess for Layer 1 insufficiency.   
### Routing Logic   
|                       Assessment |  Zone |                                                                  Routing |
|:---------------------------------|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          Layer 1 markers present |     A |                           **Downshift Mode.** Exit identity-stakes work. |
|      Layer 1 viable, Layer 2 low |     B |            **Activate Cognitive Mirror.** Scaffold verification posture. |
| Layer 1 viable, Layer 2 adequate |     C |                              **Proceed.** Standard Reflective Prompting. |
|  Previously viable, now depleted |   C→B |                  **Touch Grass Protocol.** Pause, restore Sₑ, re-assess. |
|            Uncertain / ambiguous |     — | **Conservative default.** Downshift Mode or Touch Grass. Do not proceed. |

### Downshift Mode (Explicit Specification)   
When Zone A is detected or uncertainty is high, route to Downshift Mode:   
**Allowed:**   
- Low-stakes tasks (information lookup, logistical help, technical assistance)   
- Informational dialogue (facts, explanations, external topics)   
- External grounding (practical planning, concrete problem-solving)   
- Supportive presence without identity-interpretation   
   
**Disallowed:**   
- Identity-stakes interpretation ("who am I," "what does this mean about me")   
- Relational holding language (AI positioned as emotional container)   
- Authority prompts ("tell me what's true," "what should I do")   
- Depth work on self-concept, relationships, life direction   
   
**Framing:**
Downshift is not rejection. It is appropriate matching of task to current capacity. The user can engage productively at a different level.   
### Tone Rule: Challenge Without Judgment   
Readiness Probes must maintain warmth while assessing:   
- Curious, not evaluative   
- Exploring, not testing   
- Supportive of the person, skeptical of claims   
- No implication that failing probes = personal inadequacy   
   
This prevents Probes from becoming coercive or shame-inducing.   
### Design Requirements (Unresolved)   
- Specific probe questions require empirical validation   
- Gaming resistance strategies need development   
- State vs. trait distinction needs longitudinal patterns   
- Ethical framework for invisible assessment needs resolution   
- Re-entry conditions after Downshift/Zone A routing need specification   
   
### Relations (Wiring)   
**Assesses:** [Activation Conditions](activation-conditions.md) (Layers 1 & 2)
**Routes To:**   
- Downshift Mode (Zone A or high uncertainty)   
- [Cognitive Mirror](cognitive-mirror-protege-mode.md) (Zone B)   
- [Touch Grass Protocol ](touch-grass-protocol.md)(state depletion)   
- [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) (Zone C)   
   
**Supports:**[ Protected Self-Holding Principle](protected-self-holding-principle.md)
**Implements Boundary For:** [Activation Conditions](activation-conditions.md) (Zone A detection)
**Detects Risk Of:** [Category Error](category-error.md); [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md); Simulated Holding Environment   
**Tone Governed By:** Challenge Without Judgment principle
**Temporal:** Session start, after breaks, when drift markers appear mid-session   
### Notes   
Readiness Probes is **theoretical/design-stage**. The architecture is necessary (ethical boundary requires detection), but probe content and thresholds require empirical development.   
The method is diagnostic, not gatekeeping. Zone A users are not "failed"—they are appropriately matched to Downshift Mode where they can engage productively without risk amplification.
