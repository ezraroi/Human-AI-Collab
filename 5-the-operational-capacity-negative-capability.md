# 5. The Operational Capacity: Negative Capability   
How do we distinguish "Genuine Growth" from the "Protein Shake Brain" ([PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md)) or Manic Delusion?   
- [PSB](protein-shake-brain-psb.md) (and mania-like certainty states): Characterized by Low Negative Capability. A rush to certainty, totalizing answers, and the collapse of ambiguity.   
- Genuine Growth: Characterized by High [Negative Capability](negative-capability.md). The ability to sustain uncertainty, hold partial answers, and tolerate the "tightness" of the unready-to-hand state without rushing to resolution.
