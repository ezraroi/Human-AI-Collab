# Maurice Merleau-Ponty   
Provides the **Phenomenological Ground**.
***The "I Can":*** Defined pre-reflective awareness not as "I think," but as a bodily "I can."
***The Lived Body (Leib):*** The subject-body that functions tacitly as the medium of experience.   
Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961) was a French phenomenological philosopher who emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world. Unlike the intellectual "I think" of Descartes, Merleau-Ponty posited that our primary relationship to the world is bodily and practical.   
**Relevance to Model:**   
- His distinction between [Pre-Reflective](pre-reflective-awareness.md) and [Reflective awareness](reflective-awareness.md) aligns with [Channel 1](channel-1-embodied-sensorimotor-pathway.md) (embodied signal) and [Channel 2](channel-2-symbolic.md) (symbolic articulation).   
- His concept of the "Lived Body" supports [Felt Sense](felt-sense.md) as a somatic awareness of meaning that can be used for verification, not just an emotion
