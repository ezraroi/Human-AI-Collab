# 2. The Core Mechanism: The Dual-Process of Self-Explanation   
The research validates that "[Self-Explanation](self-explanation.md)" is the cognitive equivalent of Bion's Alpha Function. It operates through two distinct mechanisms:   
1. [Gap Filling](gap-filling-inference-generation.md) (Inference Generation): Constructing new knowledge to bridge missing links.   
2. Model Repair ([Conflict Detection](conflict-detection-model-repair.md)): Identifying where the internal mental model contradicts reality (or the AI's feedback) and fixing it.   
   
The AI's Role: The AI facilitates this not by giving answers, but by acting as a Cognitive Mirror—specifically, by adopting the role of a Teachable Novice (Inverted Scaffolding). By feigning ignorance or asking for justification, the AI forces the user to fully externalize their model, making gaps and conflicts visible for repair.   
This Cognitive Mirror function operates in two modes:   
- Mode A (Expert): Provides information, frameworks, and structure for Gap Filling   
- Mode B (Novice): Feigns confusion or asks basic questions to force Model Repair   
   
Effective [Reflective Prompting](reflective-prompting.md) requires knowing when to invoke each mode.
