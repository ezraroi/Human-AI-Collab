# 4.Analytic vs. Statistical Generalization   
### Why N=1 Is Appropriate Here   
Analytic Generalization (AG) generalizes findings to theoretical propositions, not populations. This is a two-step process:   
1. Making a conceptual claim linking case findings to specific theory   
2. Applying that theory to implicate similar situations   
   
Critical Distinction: The case is not a statistical sample. It is selected because it is critical, unique, or revelatory. The replication logic treats the single case as a single experiment used to refine or support theory.   
What Cannot Be Claimed: Statistical inference about how many people will experience this transformation, or population-level effect sizes.
