# Triple Network Model   
The interaction of the DMN (Default Mode), FPN (Fronto-Parietal), and SN (Salience) networks. The DMN generates content, FPN processes it, SN switches between them.   
The **Triple Network Model** is a comprehensive framework in neuroscience that describes the functional organization of the brain based on the interaction of three major large-scale networks: the **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, the **Frontoparietal Network (FPN)**, and the **Salience Network (SN)**. The FPN is also widely known as the Central Executive Network (CEN). These three networks are reliably identifiable, spanning association areas across the frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices.   
The model's primary role is to orchestrate the shifting of neural resources between internal mental processes and external cognitive demands. The DMN is known as a task-negative network, supporting **internal mentation**, self-referential processing, and autobiographical memory. Conversely, the FPN/CEN is a task-positive network crucial for **goal-directed cognitive control**, including working memory, planning, and execution, and its activity is typically anticorrelated with the DMN.   
The **Salience Network (SN)**, anchored in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, functions as a flexible hub to coordinate the DMN and the FPN. The SN's critical role is detecting biologically or cognitively important stimuli (salience) and initiating control signals to mediate dynamic switching. For instance, the SN can suppress DMN activity to disengage internal thoughts, facilitating the activation of the FPN for goal-directed behavior. Aberrant interactions within this triple network model are implicated in a wide range of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive control deficits.
