# 1.Core Discovery   
This notebook does not extend the theoretical content of the [Third Intelligence](third-intelligence.md) model. Instead, it provides the legitimating structure that makes theoretical claims hearable in academic discourse. The research question shifts from "What is the system architecture?" to "Why should anyone believe your account of this system?"
