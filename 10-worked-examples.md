# 10. Worked Examples   
### Example 1: Protein Shake Brain (PSB)   
Situation: User asks AI for answer, AI provides perfect response immediately.   
Component mapping:   
- S\_e: Artificially high (no judgment, always agreeable)   
- S\_t: Appears infinite (instant perfect guidance)   
- D: Removed by AI (complexity absorbed before user struggles)   
- C: Stagnant (no exercise, no growth)   
- \|D-C\|: Collapses to zero (difficulty eliminated)   
   
Formula analysis:   
P(α) = (high × high) / 0 ≈ 0   
Failure mode: Challenge Void   
Why transformation fails:   
- Despite appearing perfect, system removes essential difficulty   
- Alpha-function never activates (no pressure to metabolize)   
- User outsources thinking rather than developing capacity   
- Comfortable but stagnant - learned helplessness   
   
Intervention:   
- Reintroduce productive difficulty through Reflective Prompting   
- Force user to struggle before AI provides scaffold   
- Use AI as mirror/catalyst, not answer-provider   
   
### Example 2: The Micromanager   
Situation: Manager reviews and corrects all team work, removes all challenge.   
Component mapping:   
- S\_e: May be present (boss is available, supportive)   
- S\_t: Excessive (too much guidance, does work for them)   
- D: Zero (manager handles all difficulty)   
- C: Atrophying (team loses skills)   
- \|D-C\|: Zero (no gap to bridge)   
   
Formula analysis:   
P(α) = (S\_e × excessive\_S\_t) / 0 ≈ 0   
Failure mode: Challenge Void (structural twin of PSB)   
Why transformation fails:   
- Same pattern as PSB in different domain   
- Team never enters ZPD   
- Skills atrophy rather than grow   
- Dependence increases over time   
   
Intervention:   
- Manager must step back, allow struggle   
- Delegate appropriate challenges   
- Provide support when stuck, not preemptively   
   
### Example 3: The Overwhelmed Student   
Situation: PhD student given project far beyond current capacity.   
Component mapping:   
- S\_e: Present (advisor is supportive, encouraging)   
- S\_t: Present (advisor provides guidance when asked)   
- D: Extremely high (novel, complex research)   
- C: Insufficient (lacks prerequisite knowledge)   
- \|D-C\|: Huge gap (challenge vastly exceeds capacity + support)   
   
Formula analysis:   
P(α) = (S\_e × S\_t) / HUGE ≈ 0   
Failure mode: Overwhelm   
Why transformation fails:   
- Not a safety problem (S\_e present)   
- Not a guidance problem (S\_t present)   
- Gap simply too large to bridge   
- Even good scaffolding insufficient for this gap   
   
Intervention options:   
1. Reduce D (break project into smaller chunks)   
2. Build C first (foundational courses before research)   
3. Massively increase S (near-constant mentoring)   
- Option 1 or 2 usually more practical than 3   
   
### Example 4: The Toxic Workplace   
Situation: High-pressure environment, harsh feedback culture, unrealistic demands.   
Component mapping:   
- S\_e: Zero (fear, judgment, no psychological safety)   
- S\_t: May be present (clear expectations, training available)   
- D: Often excessive   
- C: Degrading (stress, burnout)   
- \|D-C\|: Large and growing   
   
Formula analysis:   
P(α) = (0 × S\_t) / large = 0   
Failure mode: Safety Collapse (with compounding factors)   
Why transformation fails:   
- Multiplication makes S\_e = 0 fatal   
- Perfect training/guidance doesn't matter   
- Fear prevents learning   
- People in survival mode, not growth mode   
   
Intervention:   
- Must rebuild S\_e first (psychological safety)   
- Cannot fix with better training or clearer goals   
- Culture change required, not process improvement   
   
### Example 5: The Successful Therapy Session   
Situation: Client explores difficult trauma memory with skilled, attuned therapist.   
Component mapping:   
- S\_e: High (trust built over time, felt safety)   
- S\_t: High (therapist provides appropriate scaffolding)   
- D: Significant (trauma is complex, painful)   
- C: Adequate (client has developed some processing capacity)   
- \|D-C\|: Manageable gap (difficulty exceeds capacity but bridgeable with support)   
   
Formula analysis:   
P(α) = (high × high) / manageable = HIGH   
Failure mode: None - this is optimal functioning   
Why transformation succeeds:   
- Both scaffolds present (multiplication works)   
- Challenge in ZPD (gap is bridgeable)   
- Client can metabolize experience with support   
- Alpha-function activates successfully   
   
Pattern recognition:   
- Same structure as excellent teaching   
- Same structure as good coaching   
- Same structure as Reflective Prompting with AI   
- Universal pattern across transformation contexts
