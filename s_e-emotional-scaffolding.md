# S\_e (Emotional Scaffolding)   
- **Definition:** Represents the "holding environment"—the degree of safety, trust, and attuned containment in the relationship.   
- **Formula Role:** A multiplier. If $S\_e = 0$, the entire probability of growth becomes zero ($0 \* S\_t$), regardless of technical competence.   
- **System Role:** Provided by the **Human** component (YOU are the container). It depletes during sessions (requires recovery/time).   
- **Theoretical Basis:**   
    - [Winnicott](d-w-winnicott.md): "[Holding Environment](holding-environment.md)"    
    - [Bion](wilfred-bion.md): "[Container](the-container.md)" / "[Reverie](reverie.md)"
